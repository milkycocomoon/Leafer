<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Dark-green, lance-shaped leaves with purplish-red undersides make this a beautiful house plant year-round.
You can keep your plant indoors. But if you move it outdoors for the summer, keep it shaded from direct sun.
Also, check the soil every couple days so that it doesn't dry out.
</p>

<p>
Tradescantia spathacea blooms any time of year.
Small, white, 3-petaled flowers grow in the leaf axils, nestled in boat-shaped bracts, giving this plant its common names,
<i>Moses in the Cradle, Moses in a Boat</i> and <i>Boat Lily</i>.
</p>

<p><b>No flowers?</b> It's not getting enough sunlight. Grow your plant in bright, indirect light year-round to make it bloom.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaf tips</b> are caused by dry air.
Raise the humidity in winter by misting the foliage with tepid water daily, or using a cool-mist room humidifier.
Or place the pot on a tray of wet pebbles to keep the air moist around it.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> when the plant becomes crowded, probably every couple years.
Move up to a pot only 1 size larger to give it a little room to grow.
Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which leads to root rot.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your houseplant?</b> Spider mites suck plant juices, leaving leaves pale, spotted and curled.
Though you'll likely notice the webbing between leaves first - the tell-tale sign of these destructive pests.
Cut off any affected parts of the plant and treat with insecticidal soap immediately.
Aphids may attack new growth of this plant, sucking plant juices and leaving a sticky residue on the leaves.
Isolate any affected houseplant to prevent pests from moving on to nearby plants.
</p>

<p><b>Is Tradescantia poisonous?</b> Yes.
According to the ASPCA, Tradescantia species are toxic to cats and dogs, and also cause skin irritation for many people.
Keep this houseplant away from pets who may play with or chew on it. It's also a good idea to wear gloves when handling it.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division. Remove offshoots that grow around the plant with some roots attached and pot separately.
Spring is the best time to propagate Moses in the Cradle because it is starting its most vigorous time of growth.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Grow your plant in bright, indirect light year-round for good foliage color and flowers.
It will tolerate lower light levels, but the leaves will be more green than purple. Keep it out of hot, midday sun.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. In winter, allow the potting medium to dry out slightly between waterings.
Soft, limp stems may be caused by over-watering, which can lead to root rot. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly with a balanced, water-soluble houseplant fertilizer in spring and summer, while plant is actively growing.
