<p><b>How to Get Lily of the Valley Flowers to Bloom Again</b></p>
<p>Beautiful lily of the valley flowers will bloom for about 4 weeks, then can be brought back into bloom the next year. Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. When flowers die, keep soil lightly moist and give your lily indirect sunlight until it goes dormant, typically in late summer or fall.</li>
<li>2. Wait till the foliage turns yellow and withered, then cut it back. Don't pull the leaves off with your hands.
Use sharp scissors or pruners to avoid damaging the rhizome.
Put the dormant plant in a cool, dark spot giving it just enough water to prevent the rhizomes from drying out completely.</li>
<li>3. Dormant rhizomes can be restarted in winter or spring. This is a good time to divide them.
Pot 5-6 rhizomes together for an attractive planting, using fresh soil.
Place rhizomes horizontally, root-side down and top with just enough soil to cover the rhizome.
Put the pot back in a warm (about 65째-70째F/18째-21째C), bright spot (out of direct sun) and keep the soil lightly moist.
Blooms should appear in 6-8 weeks.</li>
</ul>
