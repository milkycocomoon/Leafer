<h3>General</h3>
<p>
As a young plant, its leaves start out heart-shaped, then gradually become arrowhead shaped as it matures.
S. podophyllum dark-green leaves have silvery white or cream variegation, making this a decorative and popular house plant.
</p>

<p>
There are many named varieties. Choose a plant based on the color and size you want.
Among the most popular are 'Butterfly' that features deep-green leaves with creamy white veins.
'Pixie' is a compact cultivar with small leaves.
'Imperial White' is stunning with green leaves marbled with white.
One new colorful cultivar is 'Neon Robusta', flushed with pink.

<p>
<b>Prune it back.</b> To keep arrowhead plant bushy and full, prune out the older,
climbing stems as they grow. Cut them back in early summer and you can propagate the stem tip cuttings.
</p>

<p>
<b>Repot in spring</b> every couple years, or when the plant becomes root-bound.
Use a container with drainage holes. If you want to dress up a plain pot, slip it into a cachepot.
I put pebbles in the bottom of cachepots to hold the inside pot above the drainage water.
As the water evaporates, it adds humidity to the air around your arrowhead plant - and it will love the humidity.

<p>
<b>Is arrowhead plant poisonous?</b> Yes.
Syngonium podophyllum has sap that contains calcium oxalate crystals and is toxic to pets and people and can cause skin irritation.
Recommended to wear gloves when handling this plant or washing your hands thoroughly afterward.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3-4 in (7.5-10 cm) stem tip cuttings early in summer.
For best results, dip the cut end in rooting hormone powder then stand the cutting in a pot of perlite or a half-half mix of vermiculite and peat moss.
Keep the cuttings out of sunlight and maintain the humidity around them by covering the pot with a plastic bag. Cuttings should root in about a month.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light, but no direct sun. Syngonium podophyllum can tolerate low light, but the leaves may lose their variegation.
Turn pot in front of window regularly for even growth.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the potting mix moist in summer, allowing the surface to dry out before watering again.
Water less often in winter, letting the top half of the potting mix dry out.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks from spring through fall with a balanced house plant fertilizer diluted to half the normal strength. In winter, feed monthly.
