Its broad leaves grow up to 2 ft (60 cm) long and are carried on upright stems that emerge from a narrow, central stalk.
As Ti plant grows, it naturally drops its lower leaves, becoming more tree-like with a trunk topped with a cluster of colorful foliage.
</p>

<p>
Some Ti plants have solid green leaves, but the most popular house plants include varieties with red, pink, cream,
orange or copper variegation. In the wild, Ti plants will produce pink or yellow flower spikes, but don't expect them when grown indoors.
</p>

<p><b>Clean leaves.</b> Wipe leaves gently with a damp cloth or spray with a fine mist of room-temperature water to keep them clean.
Cleaning the leaves has another advantage - it helps to prevent spider mites that love dry conditions.
</p>

<p><b>Repot young plants in spring</b> when their roots have filled the container. Move it to a pot only 1-2 inches larger.
Be sure to use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent root rot. Older, larger Ti plants can be top-dressed instead.
</p>

<p><b>Too tall? Top them.</b> You can control the plant's height by cutting it back.
New branches often grow from the base of the plant after pruning. Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
These are easy to grow from cuttings. Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root them in moist potting mix.
Keep young plants warm and raise the humidity around them.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. Leaves that lose their color and variegation aren't getting enough light.
Moving the plant near a window where it gets bright, filtered light is ideal.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall. In winter, allow the top inch (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings.
Use rainwater to avoid adding fluoride and chlorine that's often present in tap water.
If that's not practical, allow tap water to sit for 24 hours so that the chemicals in it will dissipate.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Spring through fall, feed every 2 weeks with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half.
Choose one that includes micronutrients - a magnesium deficiency will cause leaves to turn yellow. In winter, feed monthly.
