<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Soft, deeply veined leaves cover the fleshy stems that hold the feathery blooms upright, above the foliage.
The vibrant plumes of colors are eye-catching and look spectacular when grouped together in containers.
</p>

<p>
It is low-maintenance and easy to grow from seed. Some seeds are sold as "mixed" so you can enjoy a variety.
Started plants are also easy to find in garden centers in spring and summer.

<p><b>How big does Celosia argentea var. plumosa get?</b>
It'll reach a height of 6 inches to 2 ft (15-60 cm), depending on the cultivar and growing conditions.
Dwarf varieties are available, growing 6 to 8 inches (15 - 20 cm) in height.
</p>

<p><b>Does Celosia plumosa come back every year?</b>
This compact plant is a tender perennial, typically grown as an annual in cold-winter regions.
It's not likely to bloom again, so you can toss it out when it's finished blooming.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Easy to grow from seeds. Sow celosia seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost.
Seeds need to be above 70°F/21°C to germinate; use a seedling heat mat for best results.
You can expect seeds to germinate in about 10 days.
Waiting for these beauties to bloom takes more patients - expect to wait another 8 to 10 weeks for the flowers.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Full sun. You can grow this sun-lover on a windowsill or in a sunroom. Don't have a sunny spot indoors?
Moving your celosia plant outdoors for the spring and summer will give it the sunlight it needs to bloom.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water regularly and thoroughly to maintain evenly moist potting medium.
It doesn't like to dry out, but it doesn't like soggy soil either. Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent root rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly with a high-phosphorous water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half.
