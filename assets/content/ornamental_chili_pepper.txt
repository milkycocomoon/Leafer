White, star-shaped flowers grow in the leaf axils in summer and early fall,
followed by the real star of the show - colorful peppers.

However, it's a one-time production. You can expect ornamental peppers to produce fruit for up to 6 weeks.
It will not bear fruit again and is usually treated as a temporary house plant and discarded after the peppers have dried up.

Another common name for it is <i>Christmas Pepper</i>.

Peppers may be cone-shaped, round, or long and slender, depending on the variety.
But the peppers all change colors as they mature - from green to yellow to orange to red.
Some varieties have purple fruit that is almost black.

</p>

<p><b>Are ornamental pepper plants edible?</b>  They're not poisonous, but most are fiery hot and not suitable for eating.
The juice from them can cause painful burning of the eyes and mouth. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling the peppers.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Seed. Sow seeds in spring. Cover seeds with about 1/4" (6 mm) potting mix.
Don't bury them; the seeds need light and warmth to germinate. Aim to keep the seeds around 70°F/21°C or warmer.
Water lightly to keep seeds moist. You should see them sprouting in about 1-2 weeks.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light, including at least 4 hours a day of direct sun.
If you don't have a sunny spot indoors, scoot your pepper plant to your sun-drenched patio or porch for the summer.
Or set your plant under a grow light for 14 hours a day to give it the light it needs to flower and grow peppers.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist. Leaves will drop if soil is too wet or too dry.
Use a pot with drainage holes, water thoroughly, then empty drainage tray.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly. Tomato fertilizer works great for your peppers, too.
