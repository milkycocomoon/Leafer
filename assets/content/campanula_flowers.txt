Campanula flower is easy to grow indoors. It only demands cool air, moist soil and indirect sunlight.
Treat it right and you can expect masses of these violet-blue flowers to bloom in mid-to-late summer right through fall.
</p>

<p><b>Overwinter your plant.</b> It's a perennial and will flower year after year.
Cut stems back (close to the soil level of the plant) in late fall or early winter, after flowering season.
It doesn't need a cold season in winter. Give it the same temperature and light as usual.
Keep the soil on the dry side until you see new growth in spring, then resume with normal watering.
</p>

<p><b>Remove spent blooms.</b> Cut off spent flower heads using scissors or pruning shears to avoid tearing the stems.
By deadheading campanula flowers, you'll not only keep your plant looking its best, you'll encourage more blooms.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> It may be aphids. These insects are attracted to new growth, such as young leaves and flower buds.
If your plant is infested, treat it right away with an insecticide. Fungus gnats are another pest to watch for - they're attracted to moist, peaty potting mixes.
</p>

<p><b>Repoting.</b> Repot campanula plants when their roots are visible at the surface of the soil.
Wait till winter or early spring to repot - never while it's blooming. Use a planter only 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger than the old one.
Flowering plants bloom best when their roots are a little snug in the pot.
If you want to use a decorative container that doesn't have drainage holes, use it as a cachepot; just slip your plain nursery pot into the cachepot to cover it up.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and root them in water or moist potting mix. Sow seeds in spring.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright indirect light. Some direct sun in winter is fine.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil moist, but not soggy while plant is growing and flowering. Soggy soil will cause root rot.
After flowering, allow soil to become almost dry between waterings.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
