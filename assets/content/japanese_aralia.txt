<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Japanese aralia is a member of the Araliaceae family commonly grown outdoors in frost-free climates.
Indoors, it can be kept small by regular pruning.
Cut it back drastically in spring - by half when necessary - and pinch off growing tips to encourage branching.
</p>

<p>
Fatsia japonica is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub. Long, upright leaf stems hold glossy, lobed leaves with pointed tips.
Each leaf has between 7-9 lobes and can reach up to 12 in (30 cm) across.
</p>

<p>
How big does Fatsia japonica get? You can expect it to reach a height of 6 ft (1.8 m) when grown in a pot indoors.
Older plants may need staked to stand upright.
</p>

<p>
Will it bloom? Perhaps. Clusters of creamy-white flowers may appear on mature plants in fall, followed by shiny,
green fruit that turn black as they ripen. However, it rarely flowers indoors.
</p>

<p>
You can move Japanese aralia outdoors in summer if you want.
Just be sure to put it in a shaded spot outside because direct sun can burn its leaves.
</p>

<p><b>Give it a winter rest.</b> This plant needs a rest in winter.
It won't go dormant, but its growth will slow down.
Move it to a cool spot where the temperature doesn't dip below 45°F/7°C ,
water less frequently and stop fertilizing for the winter.
</p>

<p><b>Keep it clean.</b> Wipe the leaves frequently with a damp cloth to keep them dust-free.
Do not use leaf shine products, which can damage them.
This handsome plant doesn't need it anyway; its leaves are naturally shiny.
</p>

<p><b>Leaves dropping?</b> You can expect the lower, older leaves to fall off.
However, if your Japanese aralia looks too leggy, don't be afraid to prune it back hard - by half, if necessary.
Spring is the best time to prune it, when the plant is beginning its most vigorous time of growth.
</p>

<p><b>Yellow leaves</b> are often caused by soggy soil. Another cause of yellowing leaves may be lack of nutrients.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> when the plant becomes root-bound.
Use a heavy container to prevent toppling, because plants can get top-heavy.
Larger plants can be top-dressed instead by replacing the top 2-3 in (5-7.5 cm) with fresh potting mix.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your houseplant?</b> Check leaves regularly for spider mites, aphids and mealy bugs.
Isolate an infested plant and treat it immediately with insecticidal soap.
</p>

<p><b>Watch for fungus.</b> The cool, moist and shady environment F. japonica prefers may attract botrytis.
It's a fungus that looks like grayish-brown patches.
Left to grow, botrytis will cause the leaves to turn soft, curl up and possibly fall off.
Cut off any affected leaves and spray the plant with a fungicide.
It's a good idea to keep Japanese aralia where it will get good air circulation.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 4-inch (10cm) stem tip cuttings with leaves attached in spring and place in moist perlite or sterile potting mix.
Use a seedling heat mat to keep cuttings warm, and enclose cuttings in a plastic bag to maintain high humidity.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light; but no direct summer sun which can scorch its leaves.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall, slightly drier in winter when growth slows down.
Use a pot with drainage holes; water thoroughly to wet all the roots, then empty the drainage tray.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer.
Yellow leaves on Japanese aralia indicate lack of nitrogen.
