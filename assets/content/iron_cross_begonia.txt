<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Iron cross begonia leaves are easily recognizable. Each bright-green puckered leaf is marked with a reddish-brown iron-cross pattern in the center.
</p>

<p>
You may see sprays of pinkish-white flowers in spring and summer, but these blooms are insignificant compared to the magnificent foliage.
Pinching off flower buds will promote bigger, healthier leaves.
</p>

<p>
If your plant suddenly collapses and shrivels up, don't give up on it.
It's not uncommon for this begonia to go dormant in winter. While it's tempting to overwater a withered plant - stop watering during dormancy.
What this handsome begonia really craves is high humidity. Cover the plant with plastic or a glass cloche and keep the plant around 60°F/16°C for 6-8 weeks.
You'll see new leaves appear.
</p>

<p><b>Shed some light.</b> Give your begonia bright, indirect light. You'll get the best leaf color this way. It thrives under fluorescent lights.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring.</b> Move your plant up to a pot only 1 size larger. Using a small pot with a drainage hole will help to prevent overwatering.
Tamp down the soil gently with your fingers so that it doesn't pack too tightly - begonias like a little air around their roots.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch your plant.</b> Is your begonia too tall and leggy?
You can pinch off stems to keep it compact. Don't toss out those stem cuttings either - propagate them for more plants.
Leggy plants may indicate the plant isn't getting enough light, especially if it's "reaching" toward the window.
</p>

<p><b>Don't overwater.</b> This is one of the few problems with growing begonias.
Begonia masoniana has rhizomatous roots that store water, so allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Stem cuttings root easily. Take 3 in (8 cm) stem cuttings with leaves in early summer and root them in moist, sterile potting mix.
Cover with plastic or a glass cloche to raise humidity around it until new leaves form.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light.
If you're using fluorescent lights, keep the light on 14 hours a day - that's the equivalent of about 8 hours of daylight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, allowing the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings.
Avoid getting water on the leaves because they spot easily and are prone to mildew and other fungus.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly year-round with a 10-10-5 water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
Fertilize when the soil is already moist to avoid fertilizer burn. Don't feed a dormant plant.
