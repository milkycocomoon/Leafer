<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Mounds of round, saucer-like leaves shoot out from a central unbranched stem.
You don't need to prune it at all. In fact, this warm-natured West Indies native doesn't require much care.
</p>

<p>
You may see tiny, yellow-green flowers during the summer. But they're not very showy compared to the leaves.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering whether to repot...or not?</b> Are there roots growing out the drainage holes?
Sometimes you have to ease the plant out of its pot and take a peek at its roots. Are they coiled at the bottom?
If so, it's definitely time to repot. Use a pot with drainage holes to avoid soggy soil, which can lead to root rot.
If you want to use a decorative planter without holes, use it as a cachepot. Just slip a plain nursery pot in the cachepot.
I put small river rocks in the bottom of my cachepots to keep the pot above the drainage water.
This has the added benefit of raising the humidity around it - and your plant will love it.

<p><b>Leaves falling off?</b> Pilea peperomioides will naturally lose a few leaves in winter.
If it sheds more leaves than usual, it's likely caused by cold air or overwatering.
Keep it away from drafts and heat/AC vents.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer.
Cut the stem just below a node - the place where a leaf is attached. Nodes contain cells that will grow roots.
Place the cut end in moist potting mix and cover the plant loosely with a plastic bag to retain humidity.
Cuttings root easily in about a month. P. peperomioides also grows offsets in abundance - just separate them from the parent plant and pot them.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light. The foliage will lose its bright green color if the light level is too low. It's a good idea to place it in bright, indirect sunlight year-round.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Spring through fall, water thoroughly. Use a pot with drainage holes and allow soil to dry out a little between waterings.
Over-watering will cause leaves to wilt or fall off. Keep slightly drier in winter when growth is slower. Always use tepid water when watering houseplants.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer.
