<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Air plant is <i>epiphytic</i>, meaning that it lives by absorbing water and nutrients through its leaves, rather than from soil.
</p>

<p>
In its native Central and South America, Tillandsia grows on trees, using its small roots to anchor itself on a tree branch.
Because of its aerial lifestyle in the tropics,
this type of epiphyte should not be planted in ordinary potting mix which will cause its small roots to rot.
</p>

<p>
Air plants can be grown in crevices or depressions of a gnarled piece of wood,
wired onto a twig wreath with enameled florists' wire, or tucked into a seashell.
Put the plant's roots on sphagnum moss to keep them from drying out.
Do not use treated wood, or driftwood that may contain sea salt.
</p>

<p>
This tropical house plant from the Bromeliad family grows in a rosette of arching thin, green leaves,
with deep pink or red plume-like bracts, and violet-blue flowers that appear in summer.
</p>

<p><b>No blooms?</b> Tillandsias that don't bloom are likely just too young.
You can expect your plant to bloom when mature, which can take about 3 years.
Another reason for no flowers is lack of sufficient light.
Move your air plant to a brighter location, but avoid hot, direct sun which can scorch the foliage.
</p>

<p>
Tillandsia only lives for about 5 years, then deteriorates after blooming.
However, it grows offsets - called pups - around the parent plant.
Leave these pups attached until they are about half the size of the parent plant.
Propagating pups will give you an ongoing collection of beautiful plants.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Detach offsets when they reach half the size of the parent plant.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. These tropical beauties also thrive under fluorescent lights, making them good office plants.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Spray plants twice a week, until they are thoroughly wet. Or you can take them to the sink and run tepid water over them.
DO NOT soak them. Turn plants upside down to allow excess water to run off.
Standing water at the base of the leaves will cause them to rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed once a month with foliar fertilizer specially made for air plants.
