<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This stunning philodendron plant is a tree-like shrub.
Young plants have sturdy, upright stems, which tend to lie horizontally as the plant ages.
They eventually sprawl to become twice as wide as they are tall, so give your house plant plenty of room to spread out.
You may want to stake up your plant to provide support.
</p>

<p>
The foliage is stunning. When young, the glossy, heart-shaped leaves are deeply indented, and become more deeply cut as they grow.
Some varieties of split-leaf philodendron have wavy margins. Big leaves are dust-catchers.
To clean them, gently wipe the leaves with a damp cloth.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering whether to repot?</b> Pot up in spring or early summer when the roots fill the pot, usually every couple years.
Use a container with drainage holes to prevent root rot.
Once the plant gets big (top-heavy), it's a good idea to use a heavy container to prevent it from toppling.
</p>

<p><b>What do you do with aerial roots?</b> Long aerial roots may appear near the base of the plant.
You can cut off a few with pruners without hurting this plant. Better yet, tuck them back into the pot or coil them on top of the soil.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> New plant growth may attract aphids, which can cause yellow specks and crinkled leaves.
Treat any infestation immediately.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division. Cut through the thick roots with a serrated knife and pot up the plants separately.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Moderate to bright light. No direct sun, which can cause brown scorch marks on the leaves.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil moist spring through fall. Allow surface to dry out between waterings in winter. Yellow leaves are caused by overwatering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 npk) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
Lack of nutrients may cause little or no growth and small leaves.
