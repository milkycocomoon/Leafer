Acalypha wilkesiana is an evergreen perennial, so you can count on it as a decorative houseplant year-round.
The only problem with this vigorous plant is that it will quickly outgrow its space.
Don't think about moving it outdoors, unless you live in the tropics.
This beauty is native to the South Pacific Islands and prefers steady warmth and sunlight.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Does A. wilkesiana flower? Yes. Narrow, fuzzy flower spikes may appear in summer, but they are not nearly as captivating as the dramatic foliage.
</p>

<p><b>Cut it back.</b> Acalypha wilkesiana is a vigorous grower.
You'll have a big shrub before you know it, so it's a good idea to prune it back by half every spring.
You'll get more beautiful foliage this way - pruning encourages a flush of new stems and leaves.
Do not pinch off growing tips, though; this plant branches out naturally.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring.</b> Move the plant up one pot size when its roots fill the pot.
If you see roots growing through the drainage holes, it's definitely time to repot.
</p>

<p><b>Keep it warm in winter.</b> Copperleaf plant is an evergreen perennial that likes warmth and sunlight year-round.
This tropical native will tolerate a minimum of 60째F/16째C in winter, but prefers warm temperatures like we do.
Growth is slower, so water sparingly in winter and stop fertilizing till spring.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in early spring and pot them in equal parts horticultural sand and peat moss.
Use a heat mat to maintain a steady 75째F/24째C.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light is essential for good leaf color.
Put your plant where it'll get plenty of light, but protect plant from hot midday sun, which may cause brown scorch marks on leaves.
Filtered light from a south- or west-facing window will give it the light it needs.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil evenly moist year-round, but take care not to overwater.
Soggy soil will cause Acalypha wilkesiana to wilt, and may lead to root rot.
It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole; water thoroughly, then empty drainage tray.
Water less in winter, but don't allow Copperleaf plant to dry out or leaves may fall off.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>

Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer.
