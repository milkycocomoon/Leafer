<p><b>Prune your plant.</b> Pruning oleander will force the stems to branch out, giving you a much more rounded and attractive plant.
Don't be afraid to prune large plants back hard in fall, after it stops flowering.
Yearly pruning will promote vigorous new growth as well as the overall health of your plant.
Cut the stem at a 45° angle, 1/4-inch above a leaf node (the place where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem).
Oleander produces flowers at the end of new stem tips, so you'll get more flowers, too.

If you keep your plant outdoors for the summer, bring it back inside when the temperature drops to 55°F/13°C at night.
Some varieties are hardier than others, but they generally don't like the cold at all.
