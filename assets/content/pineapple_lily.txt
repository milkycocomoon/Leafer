<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This South African native grows in a ground-hugging rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves that grow to 2 ft (60 cm) tall.
The upright flower stems are typically yellow-green, sometimes flecked with dark-red spots.
Those stems are sturdy enough to hold up heavy flower heads and won't need staking.
</p>

<p>
Several varieties are available with white, pink or red flowers.
Bright-pink <i>'Aloha'</i> and <i>'Sparkling Burgundy'</i> is a popular cultivar with burgundy-tinged foliage.

<p><b>No blooms?</b> Your Pineapple Lily isn't getting enough sunlight.
If you don't have a sunny window for it, move the container outdoors to the porch or patio for the warm months to give it the sunlight it needs.
Allowing soil to dry out between waterings will also help to promote blooming.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> only when necessary. This flowering plant blooms best when pot-bound. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil.
</p>

<p><b>Overwinter E. comosa</b> in a sunny window. Cut back on watering, but don't allow the soil to dry out completely.
Stop fertilizing after flowering is over. In early spring, resume normal care.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Plant new bulbs with the pointed end barely sticking above the soil; wait to water and fertilize after new growth appears.
Divide offsets in spring every 4 years or when needed.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Pineapple lilies thrive in bright locations with some direct sun, making them ideal potted plants for the sunroom or any room that gets full sunlight.
Turn the pot each week to give each side light exposure.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water generously throughout the growing season, allowing the potting soil to dry out a bit before watering again.
Water sparingly after flowering is finished. Yellow leaves are a sign of over-watering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
