<h3>General</h3>
<p>
You can fit this palm in just about anywhere - its fronds don't branch out widely, so it only takes up vertical space in a room.
</p>

<p>
Fronds grow in a fan pattern, each consisting of deeply veined leaflets that grow up to 12 inches (30 cm)
long and 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. You'll find that the number of leaflets on each stem will vary -
typically 5 to 10 - but that just adds to this beautiful palm's appeal.
</p>

<p>
A member of the palm family, this elegant-looking plant grows in a clump of woody, upright stems.
As the lower leaves fall off, they leave scars on the stems, creating an attractive bamboo-like appearance.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> only every 3-4 years, or when this palm outgrows its container.
This plant grows best when slightly root-bound, so keep it in a smallish container.
Keeping Lady Palm confined to a small container will also dramatically limit its size.
In fact, it can be grown in a bonsai pot. When the tree grows to more than 3 ft (90 cm) tall, top dress instead.

<ul>
<li><b><i>How to top-dress a plant</i></b><li>
<li><i>Remove the top 2-3 inches of soil and replace with fresh soil every couple years.
Take care not to harm any roots that may be near the surface.</i><li>
</ul>

<p><b>Keep it moist.</b> Palms are not desert plants.
Aim to keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy, during the growing season.
Mist the foliage daily or use a room humidifier if the air is dry.
Brown leaf tips are caused by irregular watering and dry air. Snip off the brown tips with scissors, if you want.
</p>

<p>
This palm's problems are few, although dry air may attract spider mites to its leaves.
Wiping off leaves with a damp cloth from time to time will do double-duty, removing dust and keeping those pests away.

This is a slow-growing palm so buy one the size you want. More than 100 named cultivars are available, most with Asian names.
<i>'Koban'</i> is a popular cultivar with dark-green leaves. <i>'Zuikonishki'</i> has green leaflets with white stripes...
<i>'Gyokuho'</i> is a dwarf variety, as is <i>'Kodaruma'</i>, the smallest of all, reaching only a few inches high.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Lady palm can be propagated from seeds or by division,
which is the preferred method because it is faster and allows you to produce a plant that is true to the parent.
Mature lady palms grow clusters or offsets at the base of the plant.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. Too much sun will cause the leaves to turn yellow-green.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist in spring and summer. In winter, allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings.
Like other palms, it is sensitive to fluoride and other chemicals in tap water, causing leaf tips to turn brown.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer, or a light sprinkling of time-released houseplant fertilizer.
