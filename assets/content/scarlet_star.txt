<p><b>Guzmania lingulata won't need repotted until it produces offsets.</b> In fact, keeping it in a small container helps promote blooming.
</p>

<p><b>Plants bloom once and then die,</b> a slow process that takes up to 3 years.
Propagating its offsets - or pups - that grow at the base of the plant will give you a collection that blooms year after year.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Cut off the offsets (pups) when they reach 3 in (7.5 cm) tall and plant them in fresh, barely moist potting mix.
Maintain high humidity for the pups for the first month.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Put this tropical house plant in a bright location out of direct sun. Sun exposure can cause brown spots on leaves.
It will thrive in the bright fluorescent light of an office.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water the center of the rosette and keep 1 in (2.5 cm) of water in its urn (center of the rosette) at all times.
Bromes are sensitive to the chlorine and fluoride in tap water.
Use distilled water or rainwater and allow it to warm up to room-temperature first.
Houseplants hate cold water! Water soil just enough to keep the roots barely moist.
Empty old water from the urn every week and promptly replace it with fresh water.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half in the plant's urn,
then empty it after 1 week and fill with water. Or mist the leaves with a weak foliar fertilizer once a month.
