<h3>General</h3>
<p>
European Fan Palm (aka Mediterranean Fan Palm) is the only palm native to Europe, and is hardier than most palms.
Give it the warm, sunny days and cool nights of its native dry mountain habitat and you'll find that it's easy to grow.
</p>

<p>
This shrubby palm will eventually reach about 4 ft (1.2 m) tall indoors. As the plant matures, it will grow into multiple rough, thick trunks.
</p>

<p>
All new growth will come from the palm's crown - this is where you'll see new fronds. Handle this palm carefully; sharp spines line each stem.
</p>

<p>
Fine-textured fronds grow in a rounded fan of 10-20 leaflets that reach up to 24 in (60 cm) wide.
The leaflets range in color from silvery green to blue-green and naturally split as they mature.
</p>

<p><b>When to repot?</b> Repot only when needed, about every 3 years or so. European fan palm has fragile roots, so try not to disturb them while repotting.
Keep the base of the palm at the same level it was before; don't bury it because the trunk is prone to rotting if it is kept wet.
</p>

<p>
Once the plant reaches the size you want, you can top-dress it instead by replacing the top couple inches of potting mix.
Take care not to disturb any roots that may be near the surface.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves</b> may be a symptom of dry soil, dry air or an accumulation of fluoride or chlorine from tap water.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>Watering tip</i></b></li>
<li><i>Palms are sensitive to chlorine, fluoride, and other chemicals often found in tap water, as well as the salt in softened water.
Use only distilled or filtered water to avoid the build-up of chemicals.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Prune off old, brown fronds.</b> Outer fronds will wither and turn brown.
Use clean, sharp pruning shears to cut them off near the trunk of the plant.
</p>

<p><b>Yellow streaks on leaflets</b> is caused by a shortage of magnesium or potassium.
Use a fertilizer specially made for palms that include micronutrients.
You can quickly revive your houseplant with a spray of micronutrient fertilizer.
Adding a pinch of Epsom salts to the water will give it a boost of magnesium.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Sow seeds in spring, barely covering the seeds with soil. Keep them warm (75-80°F/24-27°C) and moist.
Palm seeds can take several weeks to germinate, so be patient.
European palm is one of the few palms that readily produces suckers that can be cut away and potted in their own containers.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Needs at least 4 hours of direct sun a day, and plenty of bright, indirect light the rest of the day.
Give the pot a quarter-turn every week to expose each side to sunlight. Don't have a sunny spot for your European Fan Palm?
Using an indoor grow light works beautifully.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep constantly moist in spring and summer. In fall and winter, allow top 2 in (5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings.
When grown, Chamaerops humilis is drought-tolerant. If in doubt about whether to water, it's better to err on the side of too dry than too wet.
When watering, avoid getting the base of the palm wet to prevent rot.
Use a container with drainage holes, and fast-draining potting mix to prevent soggy soil, which may lead to root rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with a fertilizer specially made for palms that contains micronutrients. Do not feed in fall and winter.
