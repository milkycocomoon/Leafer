<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Fiber Optic Grass is an ornamental grass-like sedge with small, silvery white flowers at the tips.
Its resemblance to fiber optic wire lends its common names, including  <i>Live Wire Grass</i>.
</p>

<p>
How big does it get?
This ornamental grass will grow up to 1 ft (30 cm) long, but will eventually lean over the side of the pot, rather than stand upright.
</p>

<p><b>Dry, brown foliage</b> is a symptom of dry soil. Don't allow your houseplant to dry out.
Foliage will turn yellow then brown when it gets too dry. Water thoroughly and often to keep the soil at least evenly moist at all times.
Native to marshy areas of Southern Europe and Northern Africa, fiber optic grass doesn't mind soggy soil,
so don't be stingy with the watering can.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> moving up to a container 1 size larger every 2-3 years, or when it becomes crowded.
Spring is also a good time to divide the plant, if you want.
</p>

<p><b>Is Fiber Optic Grass poisonous? </b> Yes, both the plant and seeds are toxic if eaten.
Keep them away from children and pets if there is any chance they may play with or ingest them.
Isolepis cernua can also cause skin irritation so you may want to wear gloves when handling it.
The good news is that fiber optic grass seems to shrug off pests; and if you put your plant outdoors for the summer, deer won't touch it.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Sow seed in spring, barely covering the seeds. Keep the soil warm (around 70°F/21°C) and constantly moist.
Mature plants can be divided and potted separately; spring is the best time to divide plants.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Preferably full sun; fiber optic grass will grow in indirect sunlight, but it may not grow as dense and full.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil moist or wet at all times. Constantly moist soil is needed to keep I. cernua healthy and thriving.
Native to marshlands, this is one plant you can't overwater.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
