<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Their petite 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) flowers are available in a big range of colors, including red, pink, peach, orange, white, yellow, and many combinations.
</p>

<p>
Some are shrubs and some are climbing. Train climbing miniature roses on a small trellis.
The mini roses we grow today are hybrids, with origins in China. How big do miniature roses get?
They may grow up to 2 ft (60 cm) tall, depending on the variety.
</p>

<p><b>Let the sun shine in.</b> These mini and micro hybrids won't bloom if they don't get enough sunshine.
When growing miniature roses indoors, it can be challenging to find a spot where they'll get several hours of direct sun each day.
If you don't have space in a sunny window, you can move your rose outdoors, as long as there is no danger of frost.
</p>

<p><b>Water regularly.</b> Flowering roses are thirsty, and they dry out quickly in containers.
Stick your finger in the soil to check for dryness every day or two, especially if you're growing miniature roses outdoors.
</p>

<p><b>Deadhead spent blooms.</b> Remove flowers as soon as they fade to keep plants looking their best and to encourage a long blooming season.
Don't pluck them off with your hands because tearing can damage the stem.
Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems, which can attract disease. Cut at a 45° angle.
</p>

<p><b>Pruning miniature roses.</b> New plants won't need pruning.
As they get older, you'll want to remove dead branches or any cross branches that rub against each other.
Don't be afraid to prune it back hard in fall, after flowering.
Yearly pruning will promote vigorous new growth as well as the overall health of your rose.
It also gives it an attractive shape. Use clean, pruning shears to cut the stem at a 45° angle, 1/4-inch above a leaf axil.
</p>

<p><b>Repot year-old roses.</b> Potted plants or gift baskets sometimes contain more than 1 rose plant per pot. This is a good time to divide them.
Tease apart roots with your fingers, removing as much of the original soil as possible and plant separately in small pots with drainage holes.
Repot in fall, after the flowering season is over.
