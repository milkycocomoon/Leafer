<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Clubmoss requires high humidity, so unless you live in the tropics, you'll want to boost the humidity around this plant to keep it lush and green.
</p>

<p>
Its mounding habit is made up of creeping stems that spread quickly across the soil, forming a dense mat of foliage.
Selaginella adds a wonderful texture to any plant grouping. Its unusual, branching foliage gives it another common name, Spike Moss.
</p>

<p><b>Brown, shriveled leaves</b> are the result of dry air.
Put this humidity-loving plant in a terrarium or raise the humidity around it to give it the moist air it craves.
</p>

<p><b>Prune it back</b> in spring to keep this spreading plant under control. You can prune up to half of the plant, if you want.
It's a vigorous grower and will fill out again. Don't toss out those stem cuttings, either - they root easily for more plants.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> when it outgrows its pot. Clubmoss has shallow roots, so a shallow pot will do.
Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil, which will lead to root rot.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division or stem cuttings. Take stem tip cuttings in spring or summer.
Just give the stems contact with the soil and they'll take root as they grow, forming a spreading mat.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Moderate light. Keep it out of direct sunlight, which can scorch foliage.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Aim to keep the potting medium lightly moist at all times, but don't allow the plant to sit in water.
It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent root rot.
Remember to always use room-temperature water for your tropical houseplants because cold water is a shock to them.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Selaginella is not a heavy feeder. Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) liquid fertilizer, at half strength.
Add fertilizer while watering to prevent burning the roots.
