<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Maple leaf-shaped foliage lends one of its common names.
Sometimes called <i>Chinese lantern</i> plants because of the shape of the drooping papery flowers.
</p>

<p>
You can expect the big, bell-shaped flowers of red, pink, orange, yellow or peach to cover flowering maples from spring through fall.
</p>

<p>
Abutilon is a member of the Malvaceae family, along with mallows and hollyhocks.
This genus includes more than 100 beautiful flowering shrubs. In its native habitat, it can grow up to 10 ft (3 m) tall.
Indoors, it's a good idea to keep it around 2-3 ft (60-90 cm).
</p>

<p>
Flowering maple responds well to pruning, so don't be afraid to cut it back harshly in spring - removing up to a third of the plant.
Prune back in the spring, before the most vigorous growth begins.
Pruning Abutilon regularly will keep the plant small and prevent it from becoming leggy.
Also, pinch off growing tips to promote branching.
</p>

<p><b>Water thoroughly.</b> Uneven watering can result in dry pockets in the soil.
Dry roots will quickly cause the plant to wilt, and it may drop its leaves and flowers.
Always use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> when you see new growth.
This plant blooms best when slightly pot-bound, so move it to a pot 1 size larger only when necessary.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Soft wood cuttings work best for propagating flowering maple hybrids.
Use sharp, sterilized pruners to take 4 inch (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring.
Cut off the leaves from the bottom half of the stem tip cuttings.
Then, dip the cut ends in rooting powder before planting the cuttings in moist peat-based potting mix.
Don't overpot - a 3- or 4-inch pot with drainage holes will do. Keep the potting mix lightly moist.
Use a heat mat to ensure the plants are kept at a consistent 70°F/21°C temperature.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to full sun. Shade from hot, direct midday sun which can scorch its leaves.
Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough sun. Put your plant in the brightest window possible.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, then allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.
Use a pot with drainage holes, and remember to empty the drainage tray after watering to prevent soggy soil which can lead to root rot.
If flowering maple plant gets too dry, it will quickly wilt.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
