<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Thanks to new hybrids, florists' cyclamen plants are bigger, more vigorous and showier than ever before.
Rising above heart-shaped, silver-and-green leaves are upright stems bearing beautiful backswept petals in shades of pink, purple, red or white.
</p>

<p><b>Is it poisonous to pets?</b> Yes, according to aspca.org, cyclamen contain terpenoid saponins that is toxic to cats and dogs.
</p>

<p>If your Cyclamen just came home with you, there are a couple things you should know right away.
<b>Remove any foil or plastic pot covering.</b> Why?
Although the decorative wrapping may look pretty, it's blocking the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot.
One of the things cyclamen won't tolerate is soggy soil.
<b>Don't repot.</b> Why? repotting a flowering houseplant stresses it, and it may protest by dropping its blooms. You don't want that.
If you want to cover a plain nursery pot, drop it into a cachepot</p>

<p>Winter-blooming cyclamen plant is usually bought in flower from the florist and treated as an annual, then unfortunately,
is tossed out when it begins to deteriorate in spring. However, cyclamen plant is a perennial that you can enjoy for years.</p>

<p>With good care, this cool-season, flowering house plant will last for several months, then can be brought back to bloom the next winter.
When flowers die and foliage turns yellow, cut it back. Put the dormant plant in a cool, dark spot for the summer and allow it to dry out.
In fall, put the plant back in bright light and resume watering and fertilizing. Blooms should appear in 2-3 months.</p>

<p><b>Sudden wilting of leaves and flower stems</b> is caused by dry soil. Don't worry - they'll usually come right back after a thorough watering.
Stems and flowers that don't respond can be pinched off.</p>

<p><b>Shriveled, yellow leaves</b> are a symptom of too-warm temperatures.
Remember, this beauty likes it cool. Cut off any dried leaves to keep your houseplant looking its finest.</p>

<p><b>Wet soil and poor ventilation may cause botrytis</b> - a gray, fuzzy fungus that can quickly kill the plant.
Yellowing leaves with brown patches are a sign of botrytis. Cut off the affected leaves.
Cutting off spent flowers and any yellow or shriveled leaves will help air circulation around the plant and help prevent the fungus from growing.
If the plant is badly affected, get rid of it.</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Cyclamen seeds are tiny, and slow to germinate. Sow seeds in late summer through fall. They must be kept at 70°F/21°C to germinate;
use a heating mat to maintain warmth. You'll wait about a year and a half for most varieties to bloom.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light. Some direct winter sun is okay. Don't have a sunny window? Cyclamen responds well to artificial light.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil lightly moist at all times. It's best to water cyclamen plant near the edge of the pot, not over the crown,
which may cause it to rot. Or water from below by placing pot in a saucer of tepid water for no more than 20 minutes.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks with high-phosphorus fertilizer diluted by half only while plant is budding and blooming.
