<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Ficus Alii doesn't exist in the wild. 'Alii' is a newer cultivar and makes a handsome indoor tree.
</p>

<p>
Known botanically as Ficus binnendijkii 'Alii' this member of the fig family is a fairly new cultivar.
Care is easier than for many of its relatives. You'll find it's less temperamental than F.
benjamina, that drops its leaves when it doesn't get what it wants.
However, leaf drop is possible with 'Alii' if it doesn't get enough light and regular waterings.
</p>

<p>
The long, narrow leaves are naturally glossy and taper to a point.
As this ficus tree grows, it may drop its lower leaves revealing a bare woody trunk, giving this tree a palm-like appearance.
Sometimes its trunks are braided by growers making it look like a topiary. It makes a bold statement in any brightly lit room.

<p>
Ficus are among the best for improving air quality indoors.
They're triumphant in removing toxins such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from tainted indoor air.
</p>

<p><b>Is Ficus Alii toxic to cats and dogs?</b> Yes.
According to the ASPCA, this member of the fig family (Moraceae) contains proteolytic enzyme and psoralen that can cause gastrointestinal and skin irritation.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves</b> are usually a symptom of dry air, dry soil or a build up of mineral salts in the soil.
The most efficient way for raising the humidity for houseplants is a cool-mist room humidifier.
Leach pots at least once a year to remove excess salts. It's easy to do: pour tepid water over the soil and allow water to drain;
repeat 2 or 3 more times.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves with yellow halos</b> is a symptom of over-watering.
Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. See "Water" tips below.
</p>

<p><b>Leaf drop</b> is caused by low light, dry soil, or excess salts that accumulate in the soil.
Some dropped leaves is normal, especially for plants that have been moved.
Protect your houseplant from cold drafts, heat vents or sudden changes in sunlight.
The good news is that Ficus 'Alii' will eventually replace lost leaves.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Stem tip cuttings and air layering. Propagating ficus trees is not easy for the amateur to do at home.
These trees are slow to root from either method.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Give Ficus Alii bright, indirect sunlight year-round.
It's not as fussy about being moved around as other Ficus houseplants,
such as the weeping fig, but it may drop leaves if suddenly moved into a shady corner or full sun.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water soil thoroughly, then allow top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings. Use lukewarm water because cold water may cause leaf loss.
Avoid using softened water - it contains salts which can harm ficus plants.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every other month spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) liquid fertilizer diluted to half-strength.
Fertilize after watering to prevent burning roots.
