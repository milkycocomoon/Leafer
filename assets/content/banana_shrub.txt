<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Banana shrub is a beautifully fragrant flowering plant.
If you want to add a new tropical vibe to your home - along with an intoxicating fragrance -
you'll want to give this irresistible gem a place in your home.
</p>

<p>
Its creamy yellow flowers, sometimes with a blush of purple, are small and cup-shaped, resembling mini magnolia blossoms.
However, what makes the blooms especially captivating is their sweet banana-like fragrance.
</p>

<p>
Even before it blooms, its glossy, dark-green foliage is attractive.
If you notice new leaves covered with brown fuzz, that's normal until they mature, growing to about 3-in (8 cm) long.
Michelia figo banana shrub is evergreen and makes a beautiful indoor tree year-round.
</p>

<p>
How big does banana shrub get? You can expect mature plants to reach a height of 6 to 10 ft (1.8 to 3 m).
It responds well to pruning and can be easily kept around 4-5 ft (1-1.5 m).
</p>

<p><b>Did you buy a small nursery plant?</b> It may look sparse, with few branches and leaves.
Give it time. Your banana shrub will soon grow lush and full.
And Michelia figo is eager to bloom, so you won't have to wait long for the wonderfully scented flowers.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering when to repot?</b> Pot up only when the plant fills the container, moving to a pot that's only 1-2 inches larger.
Why? Using a pot that's too big will hold too much water, which can lead to root rot.
Besides, your banana shrub blooms best when its roots are slightly root-bound.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaf tips</b> indicate dry soil or a build up of soluble salts.
Soluble salts come from the chemicals in tap water and fertilizers and can damage foliage and roots.
It's a good idea to flush salts from the soil every year.
</p>

<p><b>Prune it back.</b> Unlike many shrubs, this one is slow-growing, with a round, compact shape.
It will grow tall unless you prune it back. Winter is the best time to prune.
Cut just above a node. Cuts made here will encourage branching. Always use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings (with leaves attached) in summer.
Dip the cut ends in rooting hormone powder, then insert in sterile moist potting medium. They'll root easily in about 5-6 weeks.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to direct sun.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Small plants should be kept lightly moist. This shrub is drought-tolerant when it is grown.
For larger plants, drench and dry:
water thoroughly to moisten all the roots, then allow the top 1-2 inches to dry out before watering again.
Use a pot with drainage holes - soggy potting medium can lead to root rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2-3 weeks with a high-phosphorous fertilizer, while plant is growing (spring and summer).
