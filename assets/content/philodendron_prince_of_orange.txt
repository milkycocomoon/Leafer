New orange foliage changes to green as the plant matures.
You can help this philodendron to grow colorful new leaves by giving it plenty of indirect sunlight.

<p>
Philodendron 'Prince of Orange' is a manmade hybrid of Philodendron spp. from Central and South America.
</p>

<p>
Unlike its tree-dwelling relatives, this eye-catching philodendron hybrid won't climb.
It is a clump-forming plant growing from a ground-hugging rosette.
</p>

<p>
Short, upright stems carry large, thick leaves. It will reach a height of about 2 ft tall (60 cm) and spread about as wide.
The good news is that Philodendron 'Prince of Orange' won't need staking.
But if it gets too leggy, you can cut off some of the stems to keep the plant in shape.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering when to repot?</b> Move young plants to a pot 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger every year or two.
Don't overpot - a common mistake with houseplants. Why? A too-big container will hold too much water, which may cause root rot.
It is best to use a pot with drainage holes so you can water thoroughly without drowning your plant.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> New leaves that are yellow speckled and crinkled are a sign of aphids.
These sap-sucking insects attack soft, new growth on plants.
Rinse off the leaves with tepid water, then treat your plant with insecticidal soap.
Philodendrons seem to shrug off aphids once they've been treated. Aphids usually only attack plants that have been outdoors.
Peaty potting mixes that are kept wet may attract fungus gnats. They are difficult to spot because they are black and crawl on the soil.
These are more common indoors; and fortunately, easier to eliminate.
</p>

<p><b>Is this Philodendron poisonous?</b> Yes, all parts of the plant are toxic and the sap can cause skin irritation.
Keep the plant out of the reach of children, cats and dogs.
It is a good idea to wear gloves when pruning or repotting.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
You can propagate Philodendron Prince Of Orange through stem cuttings.
Select a healthy stem with at least two nodes and remove any lower leaves.
Place the cutting in water or a well-draining soil mix, ensuring that the node(s) are submerged or covered.
Keep the cutting in a warm and humid environment until roots develop.
Once rooted, transfer the new plant to a pot with potting soil and care for it as you would an adult plant.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. Small leaves or long spaces between leaves show that the plant is not getting enough light.
Move your philodendron plant to a brighter location, but not into hot, direct sun which can burn its leaves, causing brown scorch marks.
Don't have a sunny spot? Micans thrives under grow lights, making it an ideal office plant.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water Philodendron Micans thoroughly, then allow the top 1-inch (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out before watering again.
Always use tepid water for your houseplants because cold water is a shock to these tropical natives.
Yellow leaves are caused by over-watering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed once a month spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer, diluted to half-strength.
Stop fertilizing in winter, when growth is slow.
