<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Growing coffee plants indoors is easy. They are vigorous growers and are long-lived.
They make attractive house plants, just don't expect them to offer that morning cup of joe.
It could take a few years before you see many fruits on it. Indoors, consider Coffea arabica purely decorative.
</p>

<p>
It is an evergreen shrub that has glossy, dark-green leaves with ruffled edges on willowy stems.
The leaves can grow up to 6 in/15 cm long and about 2 in/5 cm wide on mature plants.
Indoor coffee plants are slow growing, but make attractive houseplants, even when young.
</p>

<p>
How big does it get? Coffee arabica can reach 15 ft or more in its native tropical habitat, but stays much smaller confined to a pot.
Your coffee plant will reach up to 6 ft (1.8 m) indoors. You can cut it back in spring to control its size. Pruning harshly won't hurt it at all.
</p>

<p>
Does it flower indoors? Yes. After 3 or 4 years, Coffea arabica produces star-shaped, sweetly scented white flowers in the spring.
If your coffee plant doesn't flower, it may not be getting enough light. Also, take care to keep your plant warm.
These flowers are followed by 1/2-inch green fruits which change to red then to almost black as they ripen, a process that takes several months.
Inside each ripened fruit are 2 seeds (or beans) that when properly roasted can be ground and made into coffee.
You'll only get a few spoonsful of ground coffee for your efforts, but it is possible.
</p>

<p><b>Prune coffee plant</b> back in spring to keep it bushy and full. Pruning also gives it an attractive shape.
Use clean pruning shears to cut the stem at a 45Â° angle, 1/4-inch above a leaf axil (the place where a leaf attaches to the stem).
Prune off top growth to keep this coffee bean plant small.
</p>

<p><b>Leaf drop and brown leaves</b> are a symptom of dry air. It's easy to raise the humidity for houseplants with a cool-mist room humidifier.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Save your fresh, unroasted coffee beans and sow them in spring. They're easy to germinate, growing into a young plant within a year.
You can take coffee plant cuttings, but cuttings are difficult to root, but you'll have the best chance at success by taking young stems before they have hardened.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Keep in bright light, shaded from direct sun.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil thoroughly moist but not soggy in spring and summer, barely moist in fall and winter.
Always use tepid water for watering your houseplants because cold water is a shock to them.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended amount on the label.
It's a good idea to fertilize houseplants after watering to prevent burning the roots.
