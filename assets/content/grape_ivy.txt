<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Grape Ivy is a vigorous, evergreen vine with handsome, glossy compound leaves, each bearing 3 leaflets.
Young leaves are fuzzy, giving them a silvery sheen.
It's extremely adaptable to indoor conditions and makes an easy house plant.
</p>

<p>
Pot this vine in a hanging basket to show off its beautiful trailing foliage. Large plants can be trained up a trellis or moss pole.
Its sturdy vines will scramble up any support, climbing and clinging with its curling tendrils.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch and prune.</b> Growing tips are tender and can be pinched off with your fingernails.
Regular pinching will keep your grape ivy plant compact and bushy. Don't toss out those stem tips either.
You can propagate them for more plants.
</p>

<p>
Control the plant's size by pruning every spring.
Use sharp pruners and always cut at a 45Â° angle after a leaf node (the place where a leaf attaches to the stem).
If a lower stem becomes bare, don't be afraid to cut it back at the soil level;
this vigorous houseplant will quickly grow new stems.
</p>

<p><b>Grape Ivy Winter care</b> Give it a rest in winter.
Grape ivy doesn't go dormant in the winter, but growth slows down with fewer hours of daylight.
One of the common problems with houseplant care is overwatering.
Allow soil to dry out a bit between waterings in winter and stop fertilizing until spring.
Indoor humidity can plummet during the winter months without our noticing it.
It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor, rather than guess. Spider mites are attracted to dry conditions;
you can help prevent them by using a humidity tray or a cool-mist room  humidifier.
</p>

<p><b>White dusty powder on leaves</b> is powdery mildew.
Although this tropical native likes humidity, it also needs plenty of air circulation around it to prevent this fungus. Also, don't overwater.
</p>

<p><b>Will it bloom?</b> Unlikely. Plants grown indoors will not usually produce flowers or fruit as they will in their native habitat.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3-4 in (7.5-10 cm) stem tip cuttings in late spring. Strip off the lower leaves and dip cut ends in rooting hormone powder.
Then insert cuttings in a 1:1 mixture of moist peat and perlite.
Enclose the pot in a plastic bag to maintain humidity. Roots should grow in 6-8 weeks.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright indirect sunlight. Protect your plant from direct sun, which can cause brown scorch marks on the leaves.
Although Grape Ivy is tolerant of lower light levels, it will flourish when it gets bright light.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly during the growing season, allowing the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil to dry between waterings.
Water less often in winter, when growth is slower. Shriveled leaves that fall off are a sign the soil is either too wet or too dry.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
