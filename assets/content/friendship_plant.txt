<p>
Clusters of tiny, pink-green flowers may appear in spring, but they are insignificant compared to the showy foliage.

<p><b>Pinch your plant.</b> This is a bushy, fast-growing plant with ovate leaves that grow in opposite pairs.
Pinch off growing tips, if you want, to keep the plant compact. Those cuttings will root easily, so don't toss them out.
Share them with friends or pot them up for more plants.
</p>

<p><b>Dropped leaves</b> can be caused by either dry or soggy soil.
However, you can expect the lower leaves to fall off as plants get older, making them look leggy and unattractive.
That's another good reason to propagate stem cuttings for more plants - you may want to replace your plant after a few years.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves</b> are likely caused by dry air. Raise the humidity for this tropical native if the relative humidity is low indoors.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take stem tip cuttings in spring. Put the stem in moist potting mix, then firm the mix around the stem so that it stands up.
Enclose the whole pot in a plastic bag to hold in humidity. Cuttings root easily in about a month.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Moderate to bright light. Place your plant near a window, but away from direct sunlight, which can scorch its leaves.
Give Pilea involucrata a quarter turn every few days to expose all sides to sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Use a pot with drainage holes and water thoroughly. Allow water to drain, then empty drainage tray.
Allow the potting medium to dry out a bit between waterings;
Friendship Plant won't tolerate soggy soil and may get root rot. Keep it slightly drier in winter, when growth is slower.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10) water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half.
