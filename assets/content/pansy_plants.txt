<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Velvety flowers in a rich range of colors have made pansy plants long-time favorites.
Those charming pansy "faces" are made up of 5 flat petals: 2 top, 2 side, and 1 lower petal. Typically, 2 or 3 colors are seen on each flower.
The side and bottom petals often have contrasting blotches or veins radiating from the center of the bloom.

Hybrids have also brought us a wide variety of colors and patterns to choose from, including purple, blue, violet-blue, yellow, red, pink and white.
Some purple hues look almost black. And some newer hybrids have solid colors.

Actually, pansy is a biennial, although it is usually bought in bloom, treated as an annual and tossed in the compost bin at the end of the season.
You can keep it indoors to extend the bloom time. Biennials have a 2-year life cycle.
Grown from seed, they produce foliage the first year, then flower, set seed, and die the second year.
Many newer pansy hybrids have been bred to bloom the first year.

<p><b>Deadhead pansies.</b> Pinch off flowers after they fade to promote more blooms.
It's work, yes - but you'll have a long growing season by deadheading spent flowers.
</p>

<p><b>Got a reluctant bloomer?</b> Lack of sunlight or too-high temperatures will make pansy plants fail to flower.
Yes, pansies are a little wimpy. Shade them from direct sunlight during the hottest part of the day.
</p>

<p><b>Feed it.</b> Add a little fertilizer specially made for flowering plants to your watering can every couple weeks.
Although pansies are prolific bloomers, fertilizer will give them more oomph.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Sow pansy seeds in early spring. Drop them on top of moist potting mix, then barely cover them with mix.
Seeds will germinate at room temperature. Don't expose them to sunlight until they've sprouted.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to full sun. Pansies like it cool, so if you live where the summer is hot, keep your plants in partial shade.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil moist at all times, but don't over-water. Dry soil will cause flowers to fade quickly.
If you're watering regularly and the plant wilts, root rot or stem rot is likely.
Remember to use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil. These are the most common problems with this plant.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks with a water-soluble fertilizer diluted at half-strength.
