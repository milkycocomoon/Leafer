<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Succulents take on many captivating shapes and forms, and this is one of the most fascinating.
Paddle Plant is an unusual-looking succulent that grows in a rosette of flat, round leaves.
It adds bold texture, color and form to a succulent dish garden, but this handsome houseplant is eye-catching on its own, too.
</p>

<p>
The gray-green leaves grow to about 6 in (15 cm) across and will become tinged in red when exposed to sun.
</p>

<p>
Will it bloom? Mature plants may produce a spike of fragrant, yellow flowers in spring.
</p>

<p><b>Shed some light.</b> Like most succulents, this plant grows best in bright light.
It will even enjoy some direct sun. Move it outside for the summer, if you want.
Just make the move a gradual one to avoid scorching its leaves.
Be sure to bring it back indoors if the temperature drops below 50째F/10째C at night.
</p>

<p><b>Keep it on the dry side.</b>
K. thyrsiflora is easy to grow in average room conditions, tolerating the dry air of heated homes well.
The one thing it doesn't like is soggy soil, recommended potting it in a terra cotta pot with drainage holes and using a sandy medium,
such as cactus potting mix for fast drainage.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> when it becomes crowded - but don't over-pot.
Use a container that's only slightly larger. Why? Plants grow best when their roots are snug in the pot.
</p>

<p><b>Drooping leaves</b> may be caused by lack of sunlight, over-watering or extreme under-watering.
Take care not to water the crown of the plant because it will rot; water the potting mix around the plant.
</p>

<p><b>Leaves turning red?</b> This is normal for Kalanchoe thyrsiflora when it's exposed to sunlight.
</p>

<p><b>Is Paddle Plant poisonous?</b> Yes, according to the ASPCA, members of the Kalanchoe plant family are toxic to cats and dogs.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take leaf cuttings in spring or summer and pot in moist cactus potting mix.
It's much easier to propagate from seed; Paddle Plant seeds are easy to find online.
It's a good idea to use a heat mat; succulent cuttings and seeds root fastest by maintaining an even 70째F/21째C.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Set your Paddle Plant in your sunniest window. It thrives in bright light to full sun year-round.
Give the pot a quarter turn every week or so to expose all sides to sunlight.
Although this succulent will tolerate low light for a while, its leaves may wilt.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, then allow top 2 inches of soil to dry out between waterings. Don't allow soil to get soggy or the roots may rot.
Avoid getting the leaves wet to prevent rot; water the potting mix or water from the bottom.
Remember to always use room-temperature water when watering your houseplants because cold water is a shock to them.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed quarterly with a cactus/succulent fertilizer.
