<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Each bulb produces a thick flower stem, which carries dozens of small, waxy flowers.
The hyacinth flower is highly fragrant and comes in stunning shades of blue, violet-blue, red, orange, pink, yellow or white.
Surrounding the flower stems are narrow, upright leaves.
</p>

<p>
Naturally spring-flowering, hyacinth flower bulbs are easy to force into bloom mid-winter.
The process is called forcing because the bulbs are tricked into behaving as if they've gone through a cold winter,
then brought into warmth and sunshine as if it's spring.
</p>

<p><b>Hyacinth bulbs need a cold treatment for 12 weeks to bloom.</b> You can begin the cold process anytime in fall.
October is a good time to start for mid-winter blooms. If you have a lot of bulbs, you can plant just a few at a time,
keeping the bulbs cold until you're ready to force them.
This way, you'll have pots (or vases) in bloom throughout the winter and early spring.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Choose a shallow pot (at least 3 in/7 cm deep) with drainage holes in the bottom.
Fill the pot loosely with potting mix. Set bulbs side by side - close but not touching - pointed end up.
Set bulbs so that their tips are even with pot rim. Do not press the bulbs into the mix.
It should be loose so the roots can grow through it easily. Cover with additional potting mix, leaving the tips exposed.

<li>2. Water thoroughly and discard drainage.</li>
<li>3. Move pot to a dark, cool, but not freezing, (40°F/4°C) location such as a basement, unheated garage or refrigerator.
Avoid storing bulbs near ripening fruit or vegetables which give off ethylene gas which can damage the bulbs.
Keep them in cold storage for about 12 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist.</li>
<li>4. When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, bring the pot out of cold storage and place it in a slightly warmer (50°F/10°C)
location with low light intensity. Increase watering, keeping the soil evenly moist.
Over the next few days, gradually move it toward a sunny window. Turn the pot every day for even growth.
When in full bloom, keep your grape hyacinth plant in a bright location out of direct sun to prolong the bloom.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. Growing hibiscus from cuttings can take several weeks.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light with some direct sunlight. Plants that don't get enough light will grow tall and leggy, with few blooms.
Growing hibiscus in a sunny spot outdoors for the summer will give it more blooming power.
Just be sure to bring it back inside before the temperature drops to 50°F/10°C at night. It's tropical, not cold-hardy.
Try to move your plant back inside gradually. Sudden changes in light can cause the leaves to turn yellow and drop off.
Raising the humidity around the plant can help.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly and allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.
Put it in a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks with a water-soluble fertilizer specially made for hibiscus (at half the recommended strength) while plant is growing and flowering.
