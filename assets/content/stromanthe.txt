<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Each emerald green leaf looks like a masterpiece, brushed with creamy white, light green and sometimes pink.
Its leaves are sometimes held upright, revealing red undersides.
Those leaves are typically 10-12 inches long and are held on short, upright petioles.

How big will Stromanthe sanguinea get? It will reach a height of up to 3 ft (90 cm) when confined to a container and grown indoors.
</p>

<p>
If your plant changes its "look" throughout the day, there's a reason. Stromanthe is a member of the Marantaceae family of prayer plants.
Its leaves turn to follow the sunlight throughout the day, then close at night, just like its family members.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering when to repot Stromanthe?</b> Repot when the plant appears crowded, using a pot that's just 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger.
Keep the crown of the plant at the same level it was in the old pot to prevent stem rot.
Spring is a good time, when it is starting its most vigorous time of growth. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent over-watering.
This is a good time to divide plants, if you want.

<p><b>Brown leaf tips</b> may be caused by dry air.</b> Give this South American rain forest native the moist air it craves year-round.
It's a good idea to use a humidity gauge near your tropical houseplant, rather than guess. Homes can become extremely dry in winter.
</p>

<p><b>Leaves that lose their vivid color</b> may not get enough sunlight.
Set your houseplant where it will receive bright, yet indirect light.
</p>

<p><b>Pruning</b> isn't necessary, but older leaves can be cut off when they wither and turn brown.
Use sharp pruners or scissors and cut them off close to the soil level.

</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Divide clumps in spring and pot them separately.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light is essential for good leaf color. Put your plant where it'll get plenty of light,
but protect Stromanthe sanguinea from hot midday sun, which may cause brown scorch marks on leaves.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Allow top 1-inch (2.5 cm) to dry out before watering.
Take care not to over-water - soggy soil will cause Stromanthe sanguinea stems to collapse, and may lead to root rot.
It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole; water thoroughly, then empty drainage tray.
Water less in winter, but don't allow the plant to dry out.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed once a month spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble houseplant fertilizer. Stop feeding in winter, when growth is slower.
