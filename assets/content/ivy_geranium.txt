<p><b>Pinch and prune.</b>
Pinch off new stems regularly to encourage branching and to shape them as they grow.
Deadhead spent flowers to keep your plant looking neat and to promote more blooms.
Pruning geraniums back hard in spring will keep them compact.</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring.</b>
Ivy geranium blooms best if slightly pot-bound.
Move your plant to a pot 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) larger when you see roots growing through the drainage holes.
Or keep it in the same pot and just give it fresh potting mix.</p>

<p><b>Give it a winter rest.</b>
Overwinter geraniums in a cool basement or garage with a minimum temperature of 50째F/10째C.
Water sparingly and stop fertilizing during this winter rest.</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take stem cuttings in spring and root in fresh potting mix. Geraniums are easy to grow from seeds, too. Sow seeds in early spring.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to full sun. Give your ivy leaf geranium as much light as you can spring through fall. Move it outdoors for the summer, if you like.
Just bring it back inside when the temperature drops below 50째F/10째C. This is a tender perennial that doesn't like the cold.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist, not soggy. Allow the top 1-inch (2.5 cm) of soil to dry between waterings.
Cut back on watering in winter, but don't allow the soil to dry out completely.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 3 weeks spring through fall with a high-phosphorus fertilizer diluted by half.
High-nitrogen fertilizers given to young plants will bring a lot of foliage growth, but few flowers.
To get the most blooms, use a high-phosphorus fertilizer only while the ivy geranium is budding and flowering.
