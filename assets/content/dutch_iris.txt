<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Unlike the most irises, Dutch irises grow from bulbs, not rhizomes, making them an excellent choice for forcing.
</p>

<p>
Tall, upright stems and silky, delicate blooms lend elegant beauty wherever you display them.
The flowers can grow up to 4 inches (10 cm) across are available in a rich rainbow of colors - blue, violet, white, yellow and bicolors.
</p>

<p>
Many Dutch iris varieties are available to choose from...<i>'Professor Blaauw'</i> pale blue petals with a bright yellow stripe...
<i>'Blue Pearl'</i> blooms are deep violet-blue... <i>'Discovery'</i> is one of the most popular in brilliant blue with a golden-yellow lip...
and rare <i>'Eye of the Tiger'</i> is dramatic with purple and dark-red petals.
</p>

<p><b>Dutch irises need a cold treatment for 8 weeks. Start the process in October or November for mid-winter blooms.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Choose a shallow pot (at least 3 in/7 cm deep) with drainage holes in the bottom. Fill the pot loosely with potting mix.
Set several bulbs side by side - close but not touching - pointed end up. Set bulbs so that their tips are even with pot rim.
Top with additional potting mix until just barely covered.</li>
<li>2. Water thoroughly and empty drainage saucer.</li>
<li>3. Move pot to a dark, cool, but not freezing, (35-45째F/2-7째C) location such as a basement, unheated garage or refrigerator.
Avoid storing bulbs near ripening fruit or vegetables because the ethylene gas they produce can damage them.
Keep them in cold storage for about 8 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist.</li>
<li>4. When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, bring the pot out of cold storage and place it in a warmer (60째F/16째C)
location with low light intensity. Over the next few days, gradually move it toward a sunny window.
Turn the pot every day for even growth. When in full bloom, keep irises in a sunny location.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Irises cannot be forced a second time indoors. If you want to keep them, allow the foliage to die back naturally,
then store them in a cool, dry place. Plant the bulbs in a sunny spot in your flower garden in the fall.
Dutch irises are hardy to Zone 5 and naturally bloom in early summer.
Dutch iris bulbs multiply rapidly, so you'll enjoy a profusion of these captivating irises.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Keep in a dark location during cold treatment. Cover pot with a box, pot or black garbage bag if necessary.
After shoots appear, move to bright light with some direct sun as directed above.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water sparingly until growth appears, then water enough to keep soil evenly moist. Soggy soil will cause bulbs to rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half from planting until start of blooming.
Do not fertilize while plants are in bloom.
