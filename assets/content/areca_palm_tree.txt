<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Long, feathery fronds of areca palm tree grow in a canopy shape, lending an air of elegance and sophistication to a room.
</p>

<p>
Not all palms adapt well to home conditions, but this Madagascar native does beautifully indoors.
Give areca palm tree bright, indirect sunlight and you'll enjoy it for many years.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your new palm.</b> Did you just bring it home? Palms are stressed from a change in light and humidity.
Give it a month or so to adjust to its new environment. If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot,
slip it into a cachepot - a decorative container without drainage holes.
I put river rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water.
</p>

<p>
<b>Keep it crowded.</b> Crowding its roots will help to limit this large palm's size,
which is a good thing because you're growing it indoors. Repotting areca palm tree only necessary every 3 years,
and only when its roots are severely crowded.
</p>

<p>
<b>Repot in spring.</b> The best time to repot is in spring, when this palm begins its most vigorous time of growth.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Sow seeds in spring, barely covering the seeds with soil. Keep them warm (75-80°F/24-27°C) and moist.
Areca palm seeds can take up to 6 weeks to germinate, so be patient.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright (indirect) light year-round. Give your plant a quarter turn every few days to expose all sides to light for even growth.
If you move the palm to your patio for the summer, keep it shaded from full sun. Hot, direct sunlight may turn leaves yellowish-green.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly to wet all the roots, then allow soil to dry slightly before watering again.
Water less in winter when growth has slowed. Use filtered or distilled water because tap water may contain fluoride,
chlorine and other chemicals that can damage palms. When watering, avoid getting the base of the palm wet to prevent rot.
Use a container with drainage holes, and fast-draining potting mix to prevent soggy soil.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Most indoor plants like a steady diet of liquid plant food, but not palms. Palms are slow-growing, especially indoors, and aren't heavy feeders.
Feed monthly spring and summer with a  fertilizer specially made for palms, such as Jobe's Organic granular fertilizer;
it contains the micro-nutrients this palm needs to keep it lush and green. Yellow spots or streaks indicate a lack of potassium or magnesium.
