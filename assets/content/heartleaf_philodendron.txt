<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Heartleaf philodendron is a popular house plant because it is extremely easy to grow. It's also known as the <i>Sweetheart Plant</i>.
</p>

<p>
Heart-shaped, glossy leaves emerge bronze, then quickly turn green.
The leaves are typically 2-4 in (5-10 cm) long, and cover its long, slender stems that can grow to 4 ft (1.2 m) or more.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch your plant.</b> Without pinching, it will grow with long, single stems and become lanky.
You can pinch it back anytime to help it branch out, keeping the plant bushy and full.
Always pinch after a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached to the stem). A new stem will grow from that node.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>Pinching tip</i></b></li>
<li><i>Try to pinch close to the node because any bare stem that is left will die, and the node will not grow a new stem.
Make a clean cut - you want to avoid jagged tears, which can attract disease.
You can use your fingernails to pinch, or use sharp scissors or pruners.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Wondering whether to repot?</b> It's definitely time to repot every 2-3 years, in spring or early summer.
</p>

<p><b>Wilted leaves</b> are likely because the potting medium has dried out.
Although it will tolerate dry soil, don't let it go too long without a drink.
Another possibility for wilting is root rot.
</p>

<p><b>Brown scorch marks</b> on leaves may be a symptom of exposure to hot, direct sunlight.
Or brown spots may be caused by fungus. If you mist your plant, or clean it with water, don't allow water drops to stay on the leaves.
While foliage dries quickly outdoors with good air circulation, indoor plants may stay wet for several hours, leading to fungus.
It's a good idea to cut off affected leaves.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> The only problem I've had with this easy-going philodendron is fungus gnats.
Those tiny, black insects are attracted to wet, peaty potting mixes. They're difficult to see, but you may find them crawling on the surface.
This plant is somewhat drought-tolerant, so I allowed the top couple inches of potting medium to dry out and the fungus gnats disappeared.
Aphids are attracted to new growth on soft-stemmed plants, like this one.
Treat any infestation right away to avoid pests from traveling on to your other indoor plants.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3-4 in (7.5-10 cm) stem tip cuttings in late spring. Strip off the lower leaves and dip cut ends in rooting hormone powder.
Then insert cuttings in a 1:1 mixture of moist peat and perlite.
Enclose the pot in a plastic bag to maintain humidity. Roots should grow in 6-8 weeks.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright indirect sunlight. Protect your plant from direct sun, which can cause brown scorch marks on the leaves.
Although Grape Ivy is tolerant of lower light levels, it will flourish when it gets bright light.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly during the growing season, allowing the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil to dry between waterings.
Water less often in winter, when growth is slower. Shriveled leaves that fall off are a sign the soil is either too wet or too dry.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
