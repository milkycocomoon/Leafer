<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Growing in clumps, the thin papyrus stems are topped with dark-green, grass-like rays that resemble umbrella spokes.
Some varieties have fountain-like feathery clusters.
</p>

<p>
This evergreen plant grows from thick rhizomes.
Fast-growing, it's considered a weed in some countries. However, it won't spread too far in a pot.
</p>

<p>
How big does Cyperus papyrus plant get? Fully grown plants may reach up to 10 ft (3 m) tall. Dwarf papyrus grows to 2 ft (60 cm).
</p>

<p>
Papyrus flowers in late summer, when given enough sunlight. The greenish-brown flower clusters appear at the crown of the rayed stems.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering when to repot?</b> When the roots have filled the pot, it's time to pot up.
Move up only 1- to 2-inches (2.5 - 5 cm) larger.
Spring is the best time to repot, when Papyrus plant is beginning its most vigorous time of growth.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves</b> are a symptom of dry air or dry potting medium.
Papyrus is semiaquatic - it loves water! Try to maintain humidity around your houseplant, too.
</p>

<p><b>Pale leaves or slow growth</b> are usually caused by too much shade.
Move your houseplant near a sunny window to give it the sunlight it craves.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> Spider mites love dry conditions.
They tend to attack houseplants in winter, when the humidity drops. So tiny, spider mites are about the size of pepper flakes.
You'll first notice their fine webbing between stems and leaves.
Another pest is aphids that are attracted to soft, new growth on plants. Isolate an infested plant and treat it right away.
