<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Flame violet is prized for its captivating, colorful leaves that are gorgeous year-round.
The small, bright flowers that bloom in spring and summer are merely an added attraction.
</p>

<p>
Showy leaves grow in a rosette and reach 2-3 in (5-8 cm) long.
They combine shades of green, coppery brown, lavender or pink, often with light green or silver veins.
You'll find a variety of patterns and colors available, but all have an iridescent sheen that make this houseplant irresistible.
</p>

<p>
Mature plants will produce a number of long stems, called stolons, that will quickly cover the surface of the planter or trail.
Episcias are spectacular in a hanging basket, where their stolons are allowed to cascade over the side.
</p>

<p>
You can expect bright flowers to appear in spring and continue through fall.
Dainty, tubular flowers rise above the foliage and are typically red, but may be available in orange, pink or yellow.
They flare out at the tips like trumpets and are sometimes fringed at the edges. Deep in the center of the trumpet is a yellow eye.
</p>

<p><b>Brown spots on leaves?</b> Place Episcia cupreata near a window, but away from direct sunlight, which can scorch its leaves.
Also keep your plant away from heat vents or cold blasts from doors and windows.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaf tips</b> are a symptom of dry air.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring.</b> Spring is the best time to repot, when Flame Violet is beginning its most vigorous time of growth.
It's a good idea to pot up very couple years to refresh the soil and give your plant a little more room.
Flame violet has shallow roots and a spreading habit, so a wide, shallow pot works best.
Or you can put the plant in a hanging basket and allow the stems to trail over the side of the pot.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take single leaf stem cuttings in spring. Dip the cut end in water, then rooting hormone powder.
Put the stem in moist potting mix, then firm the mix around the stem so that it stands up.
Enclose the whole pot in plastic to hold in humidity.
Roots should develop in about a month, and you should see plantlets form from the base of the cutting about a month after that.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. Flame violets that don't bloom aren't getting enough light.
Place your plant near a bright window, but out of direct sun.
Like its African Violet cousin, Episcia cupreata grows well under artificial light.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water regularly to keep soil evenly moist spring through fall. Keep slightly drier in winter when growth is slowed.
Use room-temperature water because cold water is a shock to tropical houseplants.
And take care not to get water on the leaves, which will cause spots and may lead to fungus.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with African violet fertilizer. Do not feed in winter.
