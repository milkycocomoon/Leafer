<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Bird nest fern is one of the easiest types of ferns to grow indoors.
Known botanically as Asplenium nidus, this tropical native is fast-growing and will live for many years with good care.
</p>

<p>
In its natural habitat of Southeast Asia and Tropical Australia, Asplenium nidus grows as an epiphyte (a plant that grows on trees) in the warm, moist, tropical rain forests.
</p>

<p>
It grows in the form of a deep rosette of large, shiny, spear-shaped fronds. New fronds unfurl from the center of the plant.
Its fronds are fragile, so I'd put this fern where passersby won't brush up against it.
</p>

<p>
Bird's nest fern gets its name from the unfurled fronds in the center of the plant that look like eggs in a nest.
In its native habitat, those fronds quickly reach 4 ft (1.2m) long.
</p>

<p>
Repot young plants in spring, every couple years or when the roots fill the pot.
If you find that the roots are attached to the pot, run a knife around the inside to loosen them before you can remove the rootball.
You may need to break the pot to remove it. It's a good idea to use a container with drainage holes to avoid soggy soil.
Take care not to pack down the potting mix; bird's nest fern likes a loose mixture.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Bird's nest fern is propagated by spores, which is difficult to do for the home grower.
</p>

<h3 id="light">Light</h3>
<p>
Give your plant bright, indirect sunlight. No direct sun, which can scorch the fronds. Give the pot a quarter turn each week for even growth.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent overwatering.
Water the potting mix, not the center of the rosette, otherwise it can easily rot.
Water less in winter when growth is slower. Yellow fronds are often a sign of overwatering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer at half strength.
Stop fertilizing in fall and winter, when growth is slow.
