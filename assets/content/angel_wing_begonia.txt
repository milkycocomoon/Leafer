<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Angel wing begonia house plants are gorgeous year-round.
Even when not in bloom, the elegantly shaped begonia leaves cascading down cane-like stems are beautiful.
Often spotted with white, the big, glossy green leaves feature reddish undersides.
</p>

<p>
The sprays of delicate flowers are just an added attraction.
Bloom time is different for each variety, but most angel wing begonias flower in late winter or spring,
with some giving a show of blooms several times throughout the year. Flower colors range from soft pink to coral to deep red.
</p>

<p>
How big do they get? Some angel wing begonias reach a height up to 3 ft (90 cm).
Want a small table plant? Look for dwarf varieties that grow to 1 ft (30 cm) tall.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring.</b> Move your plant up to a pot only 1 size larger.
Angel wing begonias have fibrous roots and grow best when slightly pot-bound.
Set the plant with its crown slightly above the soil line to prevent stem rot.
Tamp down the soil gently with your fingers so that it doesn't pack too tightly - begonias like a little air around their roots.
</p>

<p><b>Don't overwater.</b> This is probably the only common problem with growing begonias.
Using a small pot with a drainage hole will help to prevent overwatering. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.
The beautiful angel-winged leaves will let you know when the soil is too soggy by turning yellow and dropping off.
</p>

<p><b>Watch for yellow halos on leaves.</b> They're a sign of leaf spot - a bacteria that grows in a moist, cool environment.
Cut off affected leaves and be sure your plant has air circulation around it. However, keep it away from heat/AC vents.
</p>

<p><b>Deadhead spent flowers.</b> Cut off flowers after they dry up.
Deadheading not only keeps your begonia good-looking, it encourages more blooms.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Stem cuttings root easily. Take 3-4 in (8-10 cm) non-flowering stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and root them in moist perlite.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Give your angel begonia plenty of bright, indirect light. You'll get the best leaf color and more flowers this way.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, allowing the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. Water sparingly in winter.
Yellow leaves are a symptom of soggy soil.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with high-phosphorous liquid fertilizer diluted by half.
Take care to fertilize when the soil is already moist to avoid fertilizer burn.
