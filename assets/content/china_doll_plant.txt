<h3>General</h3>
<p>
China Doll plant is fairly new as a house plant.
Introduced to garden centers in the 1980s, it quickly became popular because of its tolerance to the warm, dry air of heated homes.
</p>

<p>
A small, evergreen shrub, it has long, bipinnate leaves with glossy, deeply veined leaflets that are about 2 in (5 cm) long.
</p>

<p>
Young plants are compact with branching, woody stems that reach about 2-ft (60 cm) long. Fast-growing, this plant will quickly become leggy if not pruned back.
</p>

<p>Pruning China Doll will keep the plant compact and beautiful. Cut off as much as you need to in spring and summer.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b><i>Pruning tip</i></b><li>
    <li><i>Always prune above a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached to the main stem).
    Use sharp pruning shears to avoid tearing the woody stems. Also, pinch off growing tips regularly to encourage the stems to branch out.</i><li>
</ul>

<p><b>Will China Doll bloom?</b> Don't bet on it. In its native habitat of subtropical Southeast Asia, mature plants will produce fragrant,
yellow bell-shaped flowers. However, China Doll Plants grown indoors rarely flower.
</p>

<p><b>Yellow leaves?</b> The keys to success with this China Doll house plant are plenty of bright, indirect light and consistently moist soil.
Yellowing leaves usually mean it has been overwatered.
</p>

<p><b>Dropped leaves</b> on China Doll are usually caused by changes in light, water or temperature.
If you just brought your new houseplant home, you may see a lot of leaves falling from it. Don't worry -
it's simply adjusting to its new environment. Radermachera sinica is a vigorous grower and will soon grow new leaves. Cut off any bare stems, if you want.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> only when its roots have filled the pot. Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil.
If you want to cover up a plain nursery pot, you can slip it into a cachepot - a decorative container without drainage holes.
You can put pebbles in the bottom of cachepots to keep the pot above the drainage water.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer.
Cut off lower leaves from the stem; use sharp pruners to cut them cleanly just above a leaf node (the place where a leaf is attached to the stem).
For best results, dip the cut stem tip in rooting hormone powder before planting. Insert the cutting into moist potting medium.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist year-round. Don't allow the soil to become soggy - or dry out. Either condition will cause the China Doll plant to drop its leaves.
Resist the temptation to over-water, which makes the problem worse. Yellow leaves are also a symptom of over-watering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed China Doll Plant every 2 weeks spring through fall with balanced (such as 10-10-10 N-P-K) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
