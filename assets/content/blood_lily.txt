<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This South African relative of the Amaryllis also grows from bulbs.
Blood Lily is warm-natured like its cousin and will begin to grow as soon as it is potted.
You can start it any time of year, as long as you can provide enough sunlight for it.
</p>

<p>
This tropical beauty has the unfortunate name Blood Lily, but is also known as <i>Fireball Lily</i> for its bright red,
orange-red or salmon-red flowers.
</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Pot bulb in a 6- to 8-inch (15-20 cm) pot, using all-purpose houseplant potting mix.
Leave the tip of the bulb above the soil line.</li>
<li>2. Water just enough to lightly moisten the potting medium.
Once you see new growth, increase watering to keep the medium evenly moist.</li>
<li>3. Feed every 2 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>Be patient - it takes several months from the time the bulb is planted until you see Blood Lily bloom. It is so worth the wait. </p>

<p>
After blooms are spent, stop watering and allow the flower stems and leaves to die down naturally.
Scadoxus multiflorus is a perennial and can be grown a few times before it begins to deteriorate in quality.
Allow the bulb to rest at least 6 months before starting it again.
Repot the bulb in fresh potting mix then follow the steps above.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Offsets may grow around the bulb. Leave them attached for 2 seasons before breaking them off and planting them in their own pots.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to full sun during growing season. Turn pot occasionally so that all sides are exposed to light for even growth.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep potting mix evenly moist, but not soggy, during growing season.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks while Blood Lily is growing. Use high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer such as 15-30-15 NPK, at half the recommended amount.
