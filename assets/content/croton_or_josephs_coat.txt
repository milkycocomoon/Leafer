<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Croton plants stiff, leathery leaves in bold colors of yellow, pink, red, orange and green make it a beautiful and popular house plant.
</p>

<p>
Crotons are not easy to please. The keys to success are plenty of sunshine, a warm, draft-free environment, moist soil, and humid air.
Dry air and soil will cause croton leaves to fall off. Give croton what it wants and you'll enjoy this tropical beauty a long time.
</p>

<p><b>Clean 'em up.</b> Keep leaves dust-free and shiny by gently wiping them with a damp cloth.
Don't use leaf-shine products or any other shine solution you may have heard about. Croton leaves are naturally slick and shiny.
</p>

<p><b>Give them space.</b> If you bought a container that has 2 or 3 plants in it (which is fairly common), keep them together for the first year or so.
When the plants seem crowded, give them the space they need by separating them.
Divide croton plants by carefully cutting through their roots with a serrated knife, then pot each plant in its own container.
</p>

<p><b>Too tall? Top them.</b> Croton plants are naturally bushy, so they shouldn't need pruning.
If they get too big, you can cut them back in spring and propagate the stem cuttings.
</p>

<p><b>To repot...or not?</b> Repot in spring, moving to a pot only 1 size larger.
You can control croton plant's size by keeping it in the same container, so that its roots are confined.
When the plant reaches the size you want, top-dress annually instead.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b><i>How to Top Dress</i></b></li>
    <li><i>Remove the top 2-3 inches of soil and replace with fresh soil every couple years.
    Take care not to harm any roots that may be near the surface.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Why are croton leaves falling off?</b> Croton may drop a couple leaves when you bring it home - it's adjusting to its new environment.
If your plant continues to drop leaves, it's likely caused by a lack of sunlight or dry soil.
</p>

<p><b>Are croton plants poisonous?</b> Yes. A member of the Euphorbia family, this plant has poisonous sap.
Don't be afraid of crotons, but take some precautions.
Keep croton away from children and pets and wear gloves while handling it.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take stem cuttings in spring and dip in rooting hormone before inserting in a half-half mix of sand and peat moss-based potting mix.
Croton cuttings root in about a month.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light and at least 3 hours of direct sun each day. Leaf color is most vibrant when the plant is getting lots of light.
If new leaves are mostly green, move the plant to a brighter location. A lack of sunlight can cause croton to drop its leaves.
Don't test it on this.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil mix evenly moist with tepid water. It's a good idea to use a pot with drainage holes. Water thoroughly, then empty the drainage saucer.
Water less in winter, when growth is slower, but don't allow the potting mix to dry out.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks from early spring through summer with a balanced liquid or water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half.
