<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Fire Flash plant care is easy. Its thick roots store water, so it is forgiving if you forget to water once in a while.
This low-maintenance houseplant doesn't even mind low light levels, although it grows best with some indirect sunlight.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves</b> are caused by dry air. Unfortunately, this is common.
Give this tropical native the humidity it craves with a cool-mist humidifier when indoor air becomes dry.
</p>

<p><b>Watch for bugs.</b> Fire Flash plant seems to shrug off pests, however it's a good idea to check it occasionally.
Scale insects, aphids, mealybugs and spider mites may invade indoor plants. Isolate any infested houseplant and treat it right away.
</p>

<p><b>Will it bloom?</b> Surprisingly, yes. Tiny, white flowers will grow on mature plants in the winter months.
Don't cut them off - this is where new leaf clusters will form.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division. As Fire Flash plant grows offsets, you can separate them.
It's best to pull the whole plant from the pot first; then use a sharp knife to cut plant roots apart.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Put Fire Flash plant where it'll get plenty of light, but protect it from hot midday sun, which may cause brown scorch marks on leaves.
Filtered light from a south- or west-facing window will give it the light it needs.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, then allow top half of soil to dry out before watering again.
Fire Flash has thick, strong roots that store water, making it drought-tolerant.
It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole and empty drainage tray. Water less in winter, but don't allow Fire Flash plant to dry out.
Also, remember to always use room-temperature water when watering houseplants because cold water is a shock to them.

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed 4 times a year with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer.
