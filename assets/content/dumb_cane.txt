<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Dumb Cane get its name from its <b>poisonous sap</b> that causes painful swelling of the mouth and throat, as well as vocal loss if eaten.
Keep it away from pets who may play with or chew on this plant.
It also can cause skin irritation, so I recommend wearing gloves while handling this plant.
</p>

<p>
Its handsome, broad leaves are about 10 inches (25 cm) long and are splashed, streaked or speckled in green and white.
</p>

<p>The older leaves may turn yellow and drop off. This is normal.<b> If new leaves fall off</b>, the plant is too cold.
Keep it away from doorways or windows where could be exposed to cold drafts.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves</b>  are caused by sporadic watering. Water regularly, but don't allow the soil to get soggy.
</p>

<p><b>Curled, crispy leaves</b> could indicate too much fertilizer.
Flush soil with clean water to wash away any accumulated fertilizer. Wait a month before feeding again.
</p>

<p><b>Scorched leaves</b> (dry, brown spots) are caused by strong, direct sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3-5 inch (8-13 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and insert in moist potting mix.
Pups that emerge from the base of the plant can be cut away and planted in their own containers.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light, no direct sun. Give plant a quarter turn every few days to expose all sides to sunlight and encourage even growth.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly and allow soil to dry out a bit between waterings. Drooping leaves on Dumb Cane indicates it's too dry.
Water regularly with room-temperature water and use a pot with drainage holes so its roots are not sitting in water.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed spring through summer every 2 weeks with a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. In fall and winter, feed monthly.
