<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Known botanically as Ceropegia woodii, this beauty has exquisite heart-shaped leaves that grow along slender stems.
Display Ceropegia in a hanging basket to show off those long, heart-studded vines.
</p>

<p>
This semi-succulent grows from 2-inch (5 cm) tubers that rest on the surface of the soil.
Several purple stems (also called runners) will grow from each tuber.
</p>

<p>
Pairs of heart-shaped leaves grow about every 3 in (8 cm) along the slender stems.
Each leaf will eventually grow to about 1-inch (2.5 cm) long.
Decorative all on their own, the leaves are splotched with a lacy pattern of silvery white on the top and are purple underneath.

<p><b>Prune it back</b> when Rosary Vine starts to look leggy.
Propagating the stem cuttings by inserting them back in the soil will give a fuller display that's lush with leaves.
</p>

<p><b>Soft, yellow leaves</b> are a symptom of over-watering. Allow potting medium to dry between waterings.
Cut off affected stems at the soil level. Don't worry, this fast-growing plant will soon replace them.
</p>

<p><b>Curling, brown or crunchy leaves</b> often are a sign of dry soil.
Although this semi-succulent is not tolerant of soggy soil, it does need watered regularly. Cut off any affected stems.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> when it gets crowded, moving to a pot only 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) bigger.
This vining plant grows from 2-inch (5 cm) tubers. Place them on the surface of the soil and they'll root quickly.
Use a sandy mix and a pot with a drainage hole to avoid soggy soil, which can cause the tubers to rot.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your houseplant?</b> Rosary Vine seems to shrug off pests,
but watch for webbing between leaves and stems - a tell-tale sign of spider mites.
These tiny pests are attracted to houseplants, especially during the winter months when indoor air can become extremely dry.
Treat any infestation immediately to prevent pests from moving on to your other houseplants.
Raising the humidity around your houseplant can help prevent an infestation.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Small tubers sometimes grow along the stems, causing the stems to branch out.
You can remove the tubers anytime and set them on the surface of the soil to grow more plants in the same pot.
</p>
<p>
Here's how: Take stem tip cuttings and insert cut ends in moist soil.
Or cut off stem tubers and place them on the surface of the soil, where they'll root quickly.
</p>
<p>
Give your cuttings indirect light to promote growth, but keep them out of harsh, direct sunlight, which can scorch young leaves.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Keep your plant in bright light (with some direct morning sun) for best color and plenty of leaves.
Long spaces between leaves are a sign it's not getting enough sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil lightly moist in spring and summer. Water sparingly in fall and winter, when growth is slow.
A semi-succulent, this plant is more tolerant of dry soil than wet. In fact, one sure-fire way to kill Rosary Vine is to over-water.
Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to stem rot or root rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with balanced water-soluble fertilizer.
It's a good idea to fertilize houseplants after watering to prevent burning roots.
Don't feed in fall and winter when growth is slower.
