<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Peperomia caperata is a compact houseplant with heart-shaped, deeply ridged leaves. A native of Brazil.
Its textured leaves and low-growing mound of foliage make it an ideal addition to a dish garden or a terrarium.
And it loves the humidity.
</p>

<p>
A member of the Piperaceae family, this plant has short stems covered by heart-shaped, deeply ridged leaves.
The leaves are green, sometimes with a blush of red, and dark green veins.
</p>

<p><b>Will it bloom?</b> Yes. In summer through early fall, you may see slender flower spikes.
They rise tall above the mound of foliage, growing from the base of the plant with reddish-purple stems.
</p>

<p>
How big does Peperomia caperata get? It may reach 8 in (20 cm) tall, depending on the variety.
</p>

<p>
The most common cultivar is <i>'Emerald Ripple'</i> with a compact growing habit...
<i>'Variegata'</i> has white leaves with a splash of green. Some have reddish-green leaves, such as <i>'Burgundy'</i>.
Another favorite is <i>'Rosso'</i> with smooth, shiny, quilted foliage.
</p>

<p><b>Don't overwater.</b> Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Water sparingly in winter, when growth is slower.
Wilting leaves is likely because drainage is poor and its roots are not getting enough oxygen.
</p>

<p><b>Black stems and lower leaves</b> are a symptom of soggy soil.
If only a few stems turn black, they can be cut off at the base.
Ease the plant out of its pot and take a peek at its roots. Are they black and mushy?
If so, the plant likely won't recover...toss it out.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> only when the plant has outgrown its pot.
Move it into a pot that's only slightly larger, because a container that's too big will hold too much water and may cause root rot.
</p>

<p><b>Leaf drop</b> may be caused by a build-up of salts in the soil from soft water or too much fertilizer.
You can see accumulated salts as a white crusty deposits on the surface of the soil. Fortunately, it's easy to flush out excess salts.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>How to Flush Out Salts</i></b></li>
<li><i>Pour plenty of room-temperature water over the soil,
drenching the soil and allowing the excess water to drain out of the drainage holes for several minutes.
Then pour more water. Empty the drainage tray.</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take leaf or stem tip cuttings in spring.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Low to bright light. Protect this plant from direct sunlight. Light from an east- or north-facing window works best.
Peperomia caperata thrives under indoor grow lights, making it a good choice for an office plant.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil barely moist. Allow the top inch of soil to dry between waterings.
Water less in winter, allowing the top half of the soil to dry out before watering again.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer, diluted by half.
Stop feeding in winter, when growth is slow.
