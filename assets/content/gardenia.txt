<h3>General</h3>
<p>
As soon as flower buds appear, step up your game and give it the perfect growing conditions.
Find a good place for your gardenia in a well-lit area that's draft-free.
Natural gas fumes will harm the plant, so growing gardenias near a gas stove or fireplace isn't a good idea.
</p>

<p>
Gardenias enjoy spending the summer outdoors. If you put it outside, keep it in a shady spot.
Bring it back in if the temperature drops below 60°F. Happy plants may bloom a second time in the fall.
</p>

<p><b>Dropped flower buds</b> may be caused by a few things.
Gardenia care includes plenty of bright light, regular watering, moderate temperatures and high humidity.
In short, gardenias protest dark, dry, hot conditions.
</p>

<p><b>Yellow leaves</b> are a symptom of overwatering. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil.
Are the leaves turning yellow, yet the leaf veins are still green? This acid-loving houseplant is nutritionally imbalanced.
Feed your gardenia. It also helps to keep it warm, year-round.
</p>

<p><b>Shape it up.</b> Pruning gardenia plants in late winter will keep them in good shape.
Cut the stem at an angle, just above a node (the place where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem). Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering when to repot?</b> Repot in late winter, when you see roots growing through the drainage holes.
You can control your houseplant's size by keeping it in a smallish container. In fact, gardenias are sometimes grown as bonsai plants.
</p>

<p><b>How to Get those Beautiful Blooms</b><p>
<ul>
<li>- Cool nights (60°F) and warm days (75°F) will trigger flower buds.</li>
<li>- Gardenia flowers need plenty of light to bloom. Place your plant where it will get several hours of bright, filtered light each day.</li>
<li>- Flowering plants are thirsty. Check the soil at least every couple days. Dry soil will cause the buds to drop. Keep it moist but not soggy, which can also cause buds to drop.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3-inch (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer.
Dip cut ends in hormone rooting powder, then place in moist potting mix.
Cover the plant with a cloche or a plastic bag to maintain humidity.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright indirect light. Some direct sunlight in winter is fine.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist during the growing season, slightly drier in winter.
With gardenia yellow leaves are usually caused by overwatering.
Use a pot with a drainage hole and allow soil to dry slightly between waterings.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed gardenias during the growing season to keep them healthy and flowering. Use a fertilizer specially made for acid-loving plants.
Feed every 2 weeks with a high-potassium fertilizer that contains iron, diluted by half.
Only fertilize when watering to avoid fertilizer burn.
