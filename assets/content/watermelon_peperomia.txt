<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This rain forest native-turned-houseplant has an easy-care nature.
Watermelon Peperomia is eye-catching, too, making it a popular indoor plant for several decades.
</p>

<p>
It's long-lasting and usually trouble-free. Any problems are usually related to watering.
</p>

<p>
Known botanically as Peperomia argyreia, this Brazil native is perennial and evergreen.
It's one of the clumping Peperomias that grow in a rosette. How big does it get?
A fully grown houseplant will reach up to 10 in (25 cm) tall, and spread about as wide.
</p>

<p>
The Peperomia family of plants offers quite a variety for growing indoors.
What really sets this beauty apart is its shiny, silvery striped foliage.
</p>

<p>
Does Watermelon Peperomia bloom? Yes, you can expect slender, green flower spikes in summer, with enough sunlight.
They're not at all showy, but one of the hallmarks of Peperomias.
</p>

<p><b>Wilted leaves</b> typically indicate a plant is thirsty.
However, this slow-growing plant will wilt from root rot, caused by over-watering. Roots need air, too.
Use a pot with drainage holes. If you want to cover a plain nursery pot, slip it into a cachepot - a decorative pot without drainage holes.
</p>

<p><b>Black leaves and stems</b> are caused by crown rot. You over-watered.
Cut off affected leaves and allow the potting mix to dry out a bit before watering again.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> only when you see roots pushing up through the soil, or growing out of the drainage holes.
Peperomia argyreia is slow-growing and grows best in a small pot.
Soil can become compact over time, so it will benefit from repotting every couple years, just to refresh the soil.
When repotting, don't pack down the soil - keep it loose.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> Wet, peaty potting mixes can attract fungus gnats.
They look like tiny black flies that hop or crawl on the soil.
Sometimes fungus gnats arrive with a plant from the garden center, or come with a bag of moist potting mix.
Treat an infestation right away because these pests will multiply quickly and move on to your other indoor plants.
Scale, mealybugs and spider mites are other possible pests.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take stem tip cuttings in spring and early summer. Watermelon Peperomia roots easily in moist perlite or potting mix.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light, but no direct sun. Small leaves or leggy stems indicate the plant is not getting enough light.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, then allow the top 2 in (5 cm) to dry out before watering again.
One of the few things that bother Peperomias is soggy soil, which can lead to root rot.
If you believe you've hopelessly over-watered, ease the plant out of its pot and take a peek at its roots.
If they're soft, brown and mushy, toss it out; it won't recover.
If the roots are firm and white, repot right away in fresh potting mix.
Water sparingly in winter, when growth is slower. Always water your houseplants with lukewarm water because cold water is a shock to them.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Peperomia argyreia is not a heavy feeder. Because it's slow-growing, too much fertilizer can burn its roots.
Feed once a month spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended strength.
