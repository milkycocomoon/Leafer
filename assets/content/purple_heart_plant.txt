<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Bunches of rich purple, lance-shaped leaves make this a beautiful house plant year-round.

<p>
In summer, you can expect small, pink 3-petaled flowers to bloom.
They grow in the leaf axils, making a stunning contrast to the dark foliage.
</p>

<p>
You can keep your plant indoors year-round. But if you move it outdoors for the summer,
keep it shaded from direct sun during the hottest part of the day. Also check the soil every couple days so that it doesn't dry out.
</p>

<p><b>Let the sun shine in.</b> Grow your plant in bright light year-round for good foliage color.
It will grow in lower light, but the leaves will be more green than purple.
Give it some direct sun, but shade it from hot, noonday sun in summer to avoid scorching its leaves.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch your plant.</b> Pinching off new stem tips will promote branching and keep Tradescantia pallida compact.
Don't toss out those cuttings - you can easily propagate them for more plants.
If your plant becomes straggly with long gaps between leaves, don't be afraid to prune stems back to about 6 in (15 cm) long.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> when you see roots growing through the drainage holes.
Move up to a pot only 1 or 2 inches (2.5 - 5 cm) larger to give it a little room to grow.
Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which leads to root rot.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. They'll root easily in moist potting mix.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light is needed to maintain the dark purple color. Some direct sun is fine, but keep your plant shaded from strong summer sun.
Long spaces between leaves indicate Tradescantia pallida needs more sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, then allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) to dry out between waterings. Water less in winter when growth is slower.
Limp, wilted stems may be a sign of root rot; cut off entire stem at the soil level.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer.
