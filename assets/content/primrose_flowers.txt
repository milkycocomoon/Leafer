<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Known botanically as Primula, these colorful beauties have origins in England, Germany and China.
A genus of about 400 species, these pretty perennials grow in rosettes of wrinkly leaves with flowers growing in the center.
</p>

<p>
Many species and hybrids offer lots of colors to choose from.
Primroses have single or double flowers in shades of pink, purple, lavender, white, yellow, apricot, and red.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch off spent blooms</b> to encourage reblooming.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaf tips</b> could be caused by dry air or a buildup of soluble salts in the soil.
You can easily flush salts by slowly pouring room-temperature water over the soil.
Wait till water drains out the drainage holes, then repeat a couple more times.
</p>

<p><b>Scorched leaves</b> (dry, brown spots) are caused by harsh sunlight.
Keep your primrose plant in bright, indirect light indoors.
If you set your plant outdoors in the spring, keep it in full shade.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your primrose plant?</b> Watch for spider mites.
Dry indoor air in the winter months encourages these pests to invade house plants, another reason to keep the humidity up.
You'll first notice faint webbing on the undersides of leaves. If your plant is badly infested, get rid of it.
These harmful pests will quickly move on to your other indoor plants.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Sow primrose flower seeds in summer and fall for winter or spring flowers (9 to 15 months later).
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. Keep plant out of direct sun, which may cause it to wilt or develop brown scorch marks.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist. Primrose flowers need frequent watering to make them happy.
Keep an indoor watering can nearby so that your plant won't go thirsty. This plant wilts quickly when the soil is dry.
Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. Yellow leaves are a sign of overwatering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Do not fertilize when in bloom.
