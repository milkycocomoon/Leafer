<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Japanese camellia shrubs have woody branches covered with thick, glossy dark-green leaves.
In the garden, they can grow several feet high; but indoors, you can keep them a reasonable size with regular pruning.
In fact, these beauties can be grown as bonsai.
</p>

<p>
You'll find Camellia japonica plants in bloom in the winter or early spring.
Big, showy camellia flowers are available in single, semi-double and double-flowered varieties.
The flowers are 3-6 inch (7.5-15 cm) wide. You'll typically find camellias in pink, red or white - sometimes speckled or striped.
</p>

<p><b>Coax more blooms.</b> Growing camellias outdoors for the summer will coax new flower buds to form.
Keep them shaded from direct sun. Camellias are tender perennials so be sure to bring them back indoors before the first frost.
</p>

<p><b>Prune in spring.</b> Pruning camellias will keep them a manageable size indoors and encourage branching.
Prune the stems back hard in spring, after flowering. Buds form on the tips of new branches, so you'll get more blooms this way.
Cut stems at a 45Â° angle, just above a node (the place where a leaf or branch is attached to the stem).
Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> Camellia diseases include black spot - a fungus that should be treated with a fungicide
specially made for black spot. Giving plants good air circulation helps to prevent any fungal disease.
Common pests are aphids and scale insects. These are more common when growing camellias outdoors; however,
it's a good idea to check your plant over and treat any infestation immediately.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> after flowering. Move up to a container 1 size larger every 2-3 years, or when needed.
If your camellia plant is already big, you can top-dress instead by removing the top 2-3 (5-7.5 cm) inches of soil and replace
it with fresh, lime-free soil.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take stem tip cuttings in winter and root in moist potting mix.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright indirect light. Some cool, direct morning sunlight is fine.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil evenly moist, especially when plant is budding and flowering.
Soil that's too wet or too dry will cause buds to drop off. After flowering, allow top of soil to dry out between waterings.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks, beginning with the first show of flower buds till the end of flowering. Use a high-phosphorus fertilizer that contains iron.
