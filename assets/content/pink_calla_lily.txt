<p><b>How to Get Pink Calla Lily to Re-Bloom</b></p>
<p>This beautiful plant will bloom for 4-6 weeks, then can be brought back to bloom the next year.

When rhizomes stop producing a good show of flowers, it's time to replace them.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. When flowers die, allow the plant to go dormant by gradually reducing the water.</li>
<li>2. Wait till the foliage turns yellow and withered, then cut it back. Leave the rhizomes in the pot and store them in a cool (40-60째F/4-16째C),
dark place giving it just enough water to prevent the rhizomes from drying out completely.</li>
<li>3. Dormant rhizomes can be restarted in January to March. Pot them in 6 in (10 cm) pots with fresh soil. Top with about 1 inch of soil to cover the rhizome.
Put the plant back in a warm, bright spot (out of direct sun) and keep the soil moist. Blooms should appear in about 8 weeks.</li>
