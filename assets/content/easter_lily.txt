<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Pots of big, beautiful trumpet-shaped blooms are a traditional Easter decoration or gift.
The pristine white flowers symbolize purity and life.
</p>

<p>When you bring your potted plant home, take off the plastic sleeve right away to provide good air circulation.
Also remove the foil covering from the pot so that the drainage holes are not blocked.
Easter lily won't tolerate soggy soil, which will cause the bulb to rot.
Cut off spent flowers to keep your plant looking its best and to coax more blooms.</p>

<li><b><i>Prolong the Bloom</i></b></li>
<li><i>As soon as the flowers open all the way, cut off the anthers.</i></li>
<li><i>This will prolong the life of the flower and also prevent the pollen from falling on the furniture or floor.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Easter lily bulbs won't bloom again indoors. If you want to keep them, you can replant the bulbs outside.
They're cold-hardy to Zone 5. Although professional greenhouse growers force them into bloom before the spring holiday,
you can expect your lilies to bloom outdoors in early summer, their natural bloom time.

<p><b>Tips for Planting and Growing Easter Lilies Outdoors</b></p>
<ul>
<li>- Plant your bulbs in the garden as soon as danger of frost has passed. Don't store them because lily bulbs don't go dormant.</li>
<li>- Choose a bright location where the plants will get at least a few hours of direct sun.</li>
<li>- Plant the bulbs 6 inches (15 cm) deep in rich, well-drained soil, 12 inches (30 cm) apart.</li>
<li>- Water well and fertilize once a month in spring and summer.</li>
<li>- Deadhead flowers as they fade and cut stems back after the foliage has turned yellow.</li>
<li>- Mulch plants in cold climates in winter to protect them. Remember to remove the mulch covering in spring to allow the new shoots to grow.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Easter lilies are easily propagated by bulb division.
The bulbs consist of scales, which can be removed and planted, and bulbs often produce bulblets.
Either one can be planted right away, but you'll need to wait about three years to have a mature, blooming plant.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light indoors.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil lightly moist while it is in bloom. It's a good idea to use a pot with a drainage hole to avoid soggy soil,
which can cause the bulb to rot. Empty drainage tray so that pot is not standing in water.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Not necessary unless you transplant the bulbs outdoors. Feed monthly with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer.
