<h3>General</h3>
<p>
As its common name suggests, Cast Iron Plant is tough. It will survive low light, infrequent watering and extreme heat that would be deadly to most plants.
</p>

<p>
This plant grows slowly, eventually reaching a height of up to 3 feet (90 cm).
It grows in a clump of 6-inch (15 cm) stems with glossy, dark-green leaves growing 24 inches (60 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) wide.
You can keep those shiny leaves dust-free by wiping them with a damp cloth. It won't really mind the dust, but you might.
</p>

<p>
Many named varieties are available.
<i>'Starry Night'</i> has leaves speckled with yellow, <i>'Milky Way'</i> is speckled with white, and <i>'Variegata'</i> has creamy stripes down the leaves.
</p>

<p>
Will it bloom? Maybe. Small, unattractive, purplish-brown flowers may appear at the plant's base in early spring.
But, don't expect them. Flowers don't appear often, and they're hardly noticeable.
</p>

<p><b>Split and damaged leaves</b> may be caused by too much fertilizer.
If leaves are starting to split, skip feeding for a month, then resume feeding with a diluted amount.
You can cut off badly damaged leaves at the soil level. It's also a good idea to flush the soluble salts that build up in the soil from fertilizers.
Fortunately, getting rid of excess salts is easy. Here's how:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b><i>How to Flush Salts</i></b><li>
    <li><i>Place your plant in a sink or take it outdoors on a warm day. Slowly pour tepid water over the potting mix.
    Allow water to drain out the drainage holes. Repeat a couple times, then empty the drainage tray.
    Flushing salts a couple times a year will make your Aspidistra healthier and takes only minutes to do.</i><li>
</ul>

<p><b>When to repot?</b> Aspidistra elatior can be moved up to a pot 1- to 2-inches larger as it grows, until a 12-inch (30 cm) pot is reached.
Older plants prefer to stay in the same pot. Want to cover up a plain pot? Slip it into a cachepot - a decorative pot without drainage holes.
You can put small rocks in the bottom of cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Divide in spring only when it gets overcrowded in its pot. A slow-grower, it probably won't need divided more often than every 5 years.
It's best to remove new shoots (with roots attached) and pot them separately than to repot an old plant.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Low to moderate light are best for this houseplant. Keep it out of direct sunlight because it can cause brown scorched marks on leaves.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
In spring and summer, water thoroughly, but allow soil to dry out before watering again. Water less in fall and winter when growth is slower.
It's a good idea to use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot. Yellow leaves are often a sign of overwatering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half.
Do not feed at all in fall and winter, as Cast Iron Plants grow very little during this time.
