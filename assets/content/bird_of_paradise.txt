<h3>General</h3>
<p>
A spectacular specimen when in bloom, but its lush, deep-green foliage is attractive on its own.
The oblong, leathery leaves have deeply textured veins and look like the leaves of a banana plant.
Give this plant plenty of room...its leaves grow to 18 in (46 cm) long.
</p>

<p>
Dazzling flowers stand above the foliage on tall stalks that rise up from the base of the plant.
Flower bracts are sharply pointed and held horizontally, looking like a bird's beak.
Bright orange and blue sepals and petals fan out from the spathe, forming the bird's colorful crest.
</p>

<p>
Bird of Paradise blooms only when mature. You can expect blooms on a plant that is more than 5 years old in spring and summer.
Each flower lasts about a week, but each spathe will produce several flowers that bloom in succession.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering when to repot bird of paradise?</b> Spring is the best time to repot,
when the plant is beginning its most vigorous time of growth. Move into a larger pot each year until it grows to about 3 ft (90 cm).
Thereafter, top-dress each year as needed. Don't over-pot; Bird of Paradise plant needs to be almost root-bound before it will bloom.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaf tips</b> may be caused by low humidity.
However, chlorine, fluoride and any other chemicals in tap water will cause browning along leaf edges.
Use distilled water or allow tap water to stand for 24 hours before using it.
</p>

<p><b>Curled leaves</b> are a symptom of dry soil and/or dry air. Water regularly and boost humidity when indoor air gets dry.
Cold blasts from entryways and AC vents can also cause leaves to curl up.
</p>

<p><b>Split leaves</b> are common for Bird of Paradise.
It's a good idea to keep your plant from high-traffic areas of your home, where passersby may brush against it.
Unfortunately, split leaves will not mend.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Seeds or division. Divide a mature plant in spring, only when absolutely necessary (i.e., it's bursting out of its pot).
The plant may not bloom again for a few years until it is almost root-bound again.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light with at least 4 hours of direct sun each day year-round.
One main reason Bird of Paradise does not bloom is insufficient light.
A south-facing window, sunroom or greenhouse is ideal to give it the light it needs.
Don't have a sunny spot for your Bird of Paradise? Use a floor lamp with a grow light.
Or move your plant outdoors for the summer, but be careful to acclimate it to the stronger light gradually or it could get sunburned. Be sure to bring the plant back inside when the temp drops in autumn.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, making sure that all the roots are watered. Use a pot with drainage holes and empty the drainage tray.
Allow the soil to dry out a bit between waterings. In winter, water sparingly.
Remember to always use tepid water when watering houseplants because cold water is a shock to them.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a liquid or water-soluble fertilizer.
