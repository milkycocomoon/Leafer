<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Masses of magnificent leaves grow above tall, slender stems. And they are big, growing about 12 in (30 cm) long.
Leaf patterns and colors can vary widely, from white with green veins and borders,
to a blush of rose pink, to spotted and marbled red, pink, green, and white.
</p>

<p>
There are hundreds of Caladium varieties to please everyone, so choose the one you like. Some popular named cultivars include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>'White Christmas'</i> has striking white foliage with green veins, blending beautifully among your green foliage plants</li>
<li><i>'Florida Cardinal'</i> is a stand-out with vivid red leaves</li>
<li><i>'Pink Beauty'</i> is a perennial favorite among gardeners</li>
<li><i>'Rosebud'</i> adds a burst of dramatic color to a container garden</li>
<li>Petit <i>'Miss Muffet'</i> is a dwarf variety with red spots</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Drooping, wilted fronds</b> are likely caused by underwatering.
It's a good idea to use a container with drainage holes so you can water your fern thoroughly, avoiding any dry pockets in the soil.
</p>

<p>
Grow caladiums in spring and summer. These South American beauties love the warmth and long daylight hours.
They're warm-natured and will begin to grow as soon as you plant them - no special treatment required.
</p>

<p><b>Overwintering: Caladium Dormancy</b></p>
<p>
Caladiums break the rule that all foliage house plants are decorative year-round.
This tuberous-rooted hybrid dies down in fall and remains dormant through the winter.
That fact - together with the need for high temperatures and high humidity -
leads to many of these plants being tossed out after their first growing season.
</p>

<p>
However, keeping plants till the next year is easy. When the foliage dies down in the fall, allow the pots to dry out.
Cut off the withered leaves, then store the pots at 65-70°F/18-21°C in a dark place.
In spring, repot the tubers in fresh potting mix and continue with care.
Tubers usually can be grown for a few years before they deteriorate in quality.
If the leaves are few and/or smaller than normal, it's time to replace them.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division. When repotting, you can break off small tubers and pot them separately.
Put each tuber in a 4-in (10 cm) pot. Plant them 1-in (2.5 cm) deep.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. Some direct morning sun is fine, but keep out of direct midday sun because it will cause leaf burn.
Several hours of light each day will produce the biggest, showiest leaves.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep potting mix constantly moist (but not soggy) throughout the growing season. Check on it often - a caladium plant can drink a lot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks with a high-nitrogen liquid fertilizer, while plant is growing.
