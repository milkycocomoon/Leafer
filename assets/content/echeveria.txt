<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This is a desert succulent from the <i>Crassulaceae family</i>. It's sometimes called <i>Hen and Chicks</i>,
although several species go by this common name and it can be difficult to tell these succulent plants apart.
</p>

<p>
All echeverias grow in a rosette 2-6 inches (5-15 cm) across on short stems.
The rosette has fleshy, blue-green leaves that become tinged with red when exposed to sun.
Handle it with care because the leaves break off easily.
</p>

<p>
<i>Echeveria fimbriata</i> has an upright, rosette form with leaves that often turn purplish-green.
You can expect it to bloom in late summer with red and orange flowers.
</p>

<p>
<i>E. elegans</i> is a popular species. It has a beautiful rosette form with tall spikes of bell-shaped blooms on pink stems appearing in summer.
Pinch them off when flowers have faded.

<p>
This is a plant that grows quickly. In fact, this succulent house plant produces offsets - called chicks - in abundance.
If they get too crowded in their pot, cut them off and propagate them.
</p>

<p><b>Give it a rest in winter.</b> Cut back on water and provide cooler temperatures - a cool, sunny room is ideal.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Offsets can be cut off and potted in their own containers. Leaf cuttings can be propagated in spring and summer.
Allow leaf to dry for 24 hours to stop the oozing of its sap. Push the cut end into moist potting mix.
Do not cover the pot with plastic because succulents are likely to rot with excessive moisture.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light with some direct sun. You can move this sun-loving succulent outdoors for the summer,
be sure to bring it back indoors when nighttime temperatures drop to 55°F/13°C; it's not cold-hardy.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the mix lightly moist spring through fall and water sparingly in winter.
Water the potting mix and not the rosette because it can easily rot.
Wrinkled leaves indicate this succulent plant needs more water.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a 2-7-7 liquid fertilizer diluted by half.
