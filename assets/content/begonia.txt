<h3>General</h3>
<p>
The begonia family includes more than 1,000 species and 10,000 hybrids and cultivars.
Ongoing breeding improves these beautiful flowering house plants, giving the new hybrids more blooms than ever before.
</p>

<p>
Begonias are full, bushy, and low-growing. Their thick, reddish stems grow from tuberous roots under the soil.
How big do they get? These hybrid begonias typically reach a height of 12-18 in (30-45 cm).
</p>

<p>
Big, soft, dark-green leaves create a beautiful backdrop for abundant clusters of delightful flowers that are available in orange, white, yellow, red, and pink.
</p>

<p>
Tuberous begonias will go dormant after flowering, but you can bring them back into bloom, if you want.
</p>

<p><b>Keep the soil moist.</b> Allowing it to dry out will leave the plant susceptible to disease.
But you don't want soggy soil, either. Overwatering your begonia will cause leaves to wilt and turn yellow.
Cut off any affected leaves as soon as you notice them. They're likely to rot and attract botrytis fungus.
</p>

<p><b>Cut off spent flowers.</b> Prune off dead flowers to keep your plant looking neat and to encourage more blooms.</p>

<p><b>Check foliage for fungus.</b> Begonias are prone to powdery mildew - a powdery white fungus that develops on its leaves.
Spray an affected plant with a fungicide and keep it away from other plants to prevent it from spreading.
Are leaves badly affected by mildew? Cut them off; it's better to lose leaves than to take a chance on the fungus spreading.
</p>

<p><b>Watch for bugs.</b> Thrips may attack, causing distorted looking flowers and leaves. Cut off any affected parts of the plant.
Spider mites are tiny, but you'll likely notice their fine webs.
Perhaps the most dreaded of houseplant pests, mites can cause a lot of damage.
Isolate any infested houseplant and treat it right away. If your plant is badly infested, get rid of it.
Mealybugs look like white cotton-like specks; remove them with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol.
Do not use oil-based insecticides on begonias to control pests, which will damage their soft foliage and flowers.
</p>

<p><b>After-Blooming Begonia Care</b></p>
<p>Begonias are challenging to maintain and regrow the following season, so they are often treated as temporary house plants.
However, it's entirely possible to bring them back into bloom the following year.</p>
<ul>
<li>- After flowering, cut back on watering so that the plant is barely moist, but not completely dry.</li>
<li>- Keep it away from light during this dormant period. In about 6-8 weeks, the foliage will die back.</li>
<li>- Cut off all the foliage, leaving 3 in (7.5 cm) stems.</li>
<li>- When new growth appears, remove the stems from the parent plant and pot them in new potting mix.
You can discard the parent plant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Divide rhizomes in spring and plant one piece per pot.
You can allow the seed pods to dry on the plant; propagate them by planting seeds in moist potting mix.
Barely cover the seeds, keep potting medium warm (about 75°F/24°C), and in bright, indirect light.
Be patient - seeds may take a few months to germinate.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Black bat flower plants need bright light to bloom, but keep them out of direct sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil lightly moist at all times.
Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil, which will cause the rhizomes to rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks with a 10-20-10 water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half while plant is growing and flowering.
Do not feed in winter.
