<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Its long, cylindrical stems are jointed, branching naturally. You won't need to prune it, unless you want.
</p>

<p>
Handle the plant carefully - those stems are fragile and may break off at the stem joints.
</p>

<p>
You can expect small greenish-white flowers to appear in late winter or spring, followed by white fruits that look similar to the berries on mistletoe.
You'll often find this plant labeled Mistletoe Cactus.
</p>

<p>
Although this is a true cactus, its origins are in the tropical rain forests, where Rhipsalis makes its home as an epiphyte,
hanging on a tree branch. Forget what you think you know about cacti, this one is a jungle native and needs high humidity and indirect sunlight.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering when to repot?</b> Repot every couple years, keeping this sprawling succulent in a smallish pot.
Wait till the spring flowers have faded - never repot a plant while it's blooming.
</p>

<p><b>Shriveled, reddish stems</b> are caused by too much sunlight.
Shade mistletoe cactus from hot, direct sunlight, especially in summer.
</p>

<p><b>No blooms?</b> Provide plenty of bright, indirect light. Fertilize your plant to encourage flowering.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Use a sharp, clean knife, scissors or a razor blade to take stem cuttings.
A milky, white sap may ooze from the cuttings, so allow the cut ends to dry for a day or two.
Then insert the cut end into a sterile potting medium. Keep the medium lightly moist.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright indirect light year-round. Shade from direct sunlight, especially in summer,
which causes the stems to turn red and look shriveled. This tropical cactus thrives under indoor grow lights.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
In spring and summer, allow the potting medium to dry out slightly between waterings; water less in winter.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed once a month with a fertilizer specially made for cacti and succulents.
