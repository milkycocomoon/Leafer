<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Big, velvety gerbera flowers are showy and long-lasting. They are held on thick, leafless stems above large, deeply veined leaves.
The leaves are about 6 in (15 cm) long and are soft and furry on the undersides.
</p>

<p>
Gerbera daisy colors range from soft pink, white and pale yellow to bright shades of pink, orange, purple and red.
Newer hybrids are compact and produce up to 6 blooms at a time, making them ideal for growing indoors.
</p>

<p><b>New plant?</b> When you bring home a fresh pot of gerbera daisies, remove the decorative wrapping on the pot as soon as possible.
Excess water will collect in the foil or plastic sleeve rather than drain, waterlogging the roots.
Want to cover up a plain nursery pot? Slip it into a cachepot - a decorative container without drainage holes.
It's a good idea to put small rocks in the bottom of cachepots to hold the inner pot above the drainage water.

<p><b>Breathe easier.</b> They're not only beautiful, gerber daisies are good for you, too.
Gerberas are among the best plants for improving indoor air quality.
They have one of the top removal rates of toxins such as formaldehyde and benzene from tainted indoor air.
</p>

<p><b>Give gerbera plant some air.</b> Allowing good air circulation around the plant will help to prevent leaf spot.
This fungus will show up on the leaves as brown spots surrounded by light-colored borders.
Isolate the plant and cut off any affected leaves. Treat with a fungicide made for leaf spot, if necessary.
</p>

<p><b>Get more blooms.</b> Once a flower fades, cut off the flower stem at the base of the plant.
Called deadheading, removing spent flowers will encourage gerberas to keep blooming.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division or seeds.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to full sun. Put your gerbera daisy plant on a bright windowsill, where it will get some direct sunlight.
Growing gerbera daisies on your patio is another option, as long as the temperature doesn't rise above 75°F/24°C.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Drench and dry. Water thoroughly. With gerbera daisy care should be taken not to allow any dry pockets around the roots,
which can cause the plant to wilt. Water until you see water coming out the drainage hole and discard any water left in the saucer.
Don't water again until the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) of soil is dry.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks while in bloom with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer.
