<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Arching fronds densely covered with small, round leaflets makes this New Zealand native an eye-catching accent for any brightly lit room.
Place this fern on a plant stand among other tropical plants or put it in a hanging basket and allow the trail of leathery,
button-shaped leaflets to cascade over the side.
</p>

<p>
Caring for button fern is easy. Unlike most ferns, <i>Pellaea</i> tolerates fairly dry conditions. One thing this fern won't tolerate is soggy soil.
</p>

<p><b>Drooping, wilted fronds</b>are likely caused by underwatering.
It's a good idea to use a container with drainage holes so you can water your fern thoroughly, avoiding any dry pockets in the soil.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> when the roots have filled the pot.
Move the fern to a pot that's only slightly larger. Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil.
This is a good time to divide the fern, if you want.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves</b> are caused by high temperatures (above 75°F/24°C) or dry air.
Trim off dry leaflets and raise the humidity around your plant.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division. In spring, divide the plant into 2 or 3 sections with a sharp knife and pot them up.
Be sure to get roots with stems attached. Fern spores can be propagated, but germination takes a few months and is not always reliable.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light, but no direct sun.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, then allow the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out slightly before watering again.
Fronds that are yellow and wilted are a sign of overwatering. Cut back on water and trim off damaged fronds.
Check the plant's roots to see if they have rotted -- if they're mostly black, get rid of it. It's too far gone.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly year-round with a 20-20-10 water-soluble fertilizer at half strength.
