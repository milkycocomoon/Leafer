<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Sago Palm belongs to one of the oldest-known plant families and is one of the most majestic.
Despite its common name, it's not really a palm but a Cycad,
one of the most primitive of plant families that covered the earth during the age of dinosaurs 200 million years ago.
</p>

<p>
This Japanese native is extremely slow-growing, but over many years develops a substantial trunk.
</p>

<p>
Topping the trunk is a rosette of shiny, stiff, narrow fronds arching slightly at their tips. Fronds will grow up to 3 ft (90 cm) long.
Although the rigid leaves appear tough, they are easily damaged and should be handled carefully.
</p>

<p><b>Water carefully.</b> Sago Palm problems are usually related to watering.
Yellowing leaves are often caused by overwatering or underwatering. Follow the watering instructions below to avoid crown rot.
It's almost impossible to treat and plants may not recover.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> Scale insects are the most common pest.
Look over your plant often for scale and treat any infestation immediately with insecticide.
Another pest to watch for is spider mites that multiply quickly and can cover a houseplant with webs.
</p>

<p><b>Is Sago Palm poisonous?</b> Yes. All parts of Cycas revoluta are poisonous, especially the seeds which can be lethal.
Keep it out of the reach of children, cats and dogs that may play with or ingest this plant.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Seeds take months to germinate and years to grow into a tree. Everything about this plant is slow.
Mature plants grow offsets - called pups - that can be separated and planted into their own containers.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light with some direct sun. Turn the pot a quarter turn at least once a week during the growing season.
Otherwise, the plant will lean toward the light source.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Take care to water the soil, not the crown of the plant which can lead to crown rot and may kill the plant.
Water thoroughly and allow the soil to dry out a bit between waterings, but don't allow it to dry out completely.
Water less in winter when growth is slower. Provide good drainage.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a liquid fertilizer (such as 18-6-18) diluted by half.
Only fertilize when watering to avoid fertilizer burn. A slow-release fertilizer also works well,
but I only use half the amount recommended on the package. The leaves will shrivel and dry up when it has been over-fed.
