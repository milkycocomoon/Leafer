<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Splattered leaves make Polka Dot Plant an unusual and captivating house plant.
Many are pink, however newer hybrids give us stunning new choices, including red or white spotted leaves.
</p>

<p>
Insignificant purple flower spikes may appear.
Pinch them off because they detract from the foliage and can cause the plant to deteriorate after blooming.
</p>

<p><b>Shed some light.</b> Leaves may revert to solid-green in low light.
Put Polka Dot Plant where it'll get plenty of light, but out of direct sun.
Filtered light from a south- or west-facing window will give it the light it needs.
If you move your plant outdoors for the summer, keep it fully shaded from hot sun,
which can cause leaves to curl up and develop brown scorch marks.
</p>

<p><b>Keep up the humidity.</b> If relative humidity drops below 50%,
use a humidity tray or room humidifier to increase the moisture in the air.
Grouping plants also helps to maintain the humidity around them.
A terrarium is an ideal home for this humidity-loving plant, where it will add eye-catching color among green foliage plants.
</p>

<p><b>Water regularly.</b> Keep the soil lightly moist, but take care not to overwater.
Too-dry soil will cause leaves to wilt and drop off. Quickly revive a wilted plant with a thorough watering.
Soggy soil will cause the leaves to turn yellow.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch your plant.</b> Pinch off tall stems to prevent the plant from getting too leggy.
Also, pinch off growing tips to encourage stems to branch out for a fuller, bushier plant.
</p>

<p><b>Curled-up leaves</b> are typically the symptom of too much sun.
Hypoestes phyllostachya needs bright, indirect light to maintain its color, but keep it out of hot, direct sunlight.
</p>

<p><b>Dropped leaves</b> are caused by dry soil. This Madagascar native likes consistent watering, but not soggy soil.
Over-watering may cause <b>yellow leaves that fall off</b>.
Always use a container with drainage holes so you can water thoroughly without worry of drowning your plant.
If you think you've hopelessly over-watered, repot it right away in fresh soil.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Grows easily from seeds. Take stem cuttings in spring and early summer.

Polka Dot Plant will lose its variegation in low light. Give your plant plenty of bright, indirect light for sensational color.
Protect plants from direct sun to prevent scorching leaves.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil lightly, evenly moist spring through fall, and slightly drier in winter when growth is slower.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced liquid or water-soluble fertilizer mixed at half the regular strength.
