<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Although most types of ferns require high humidity, Rabbit Foot Fern is much easier to please as indoor ferns.
</p>

<p>
Elegant, lacy fronds create a lush mound of evergreen foliage.
The main attraction of this fern, however, are the furry rhizomes that hang over the side of the container.
These light-brown, creeping rhizomes are covered with hairs that look like a rabbit's foot.
</p>

<p>
It's a good idea to put the plant in a hanging basket because they can grow up to 2 ft (60 cm) long.
</p>

<p>
Those furry rhizomes are more than eye-catching - they take up moisture.
Mist them every day - or as needed - with tepid water to prevent them from drying out.
</p>

<p>
This Pacific island native tends to lose some of its leaflets in winter. This is normal, and don't worry...
this vigorous plant will replace them. Raising the humidity can help.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> only when it gets crowded in its pot.
Rabbit's foot fern has a shallow root system, so move it to a shallow pot only 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) wider.
Keep the furry rhizomes on the soil surface because if you bury them, they'll easily rot.
This is a good time to divide the plant, if you want.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i>Winter care</i></b></li>
<li><i>Cut back on watering during the winter months, when growth slows.
Put rabbit foot fern in a cooler spot for the winter, but don't expose it to temperatures below 55°F/13°C.
Keep it away from heat vents and drafts.</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division. In spring and summer, divide rhizomes, each with roots and stems attached. Pot in moist potting mix.
The rhizomes hold a lot of water, so be careful not to overwater or they'll rot.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Moderate to bright light. Keep it out of direct sun, which will scorch its leaflets. Fluorescent grow lights work well, too.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Spring through fall, keep the soil moist, but not soggy. In winter, allow top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half.
