<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This fast-growing evergreen has a low, spreading habit that spills beautifully over the sides of a container.
It won't grow far though, because the creeping stems need to have contact with the soil.
</p>

<p>
Although this creeping plant seems well-suited for the moist environment of a terrarium, it is invasive and will crowd other plants.
It's recommended putting it in its own pot. Trim with scissors any time to keep it under control.
</p>

<p>
Does it bloom? Given enough light, Baby's Tears may produce tiny, single flowers in the leaf axils; however, they are barely noticeable. It typically blooms in summer.
</p>

<p>
Repot S. soleirolii in spring, when it outgrows its pot - a wide, shallow pot will do.
It makes a beautiful groundcover when planted under tall potted plants; however, it's a good idea to combine Baby's Tears with plants that prefer constant moisture.
</p>

<p>
<b>Brown, dry leaves</b> may be caused by exposure to hot, direct sunlight. Or your plant dried out.
Remember to keep the potting medium moist and raise the humidity around it.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Baby's Tears has shallow roots and can be propagated by division.
Divide plant into smaller clumps by gently pulling it apart. Be sure there are roots attached.
You can just set the separated plants on top of potting medium, water, and they'll readily take root.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Will grow in low light, but prefers bright, indirect light. Keep out of direct sun, which will scorch the leaves.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the potting medium moist at all times. It will not tolerate dry soil.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through summer with balanced water-soluble houseplant fertilizer diluted by half.
