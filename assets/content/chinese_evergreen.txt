<h3>General</h3>
<p>
A very adaptable plant, Aglaonema tolerates low light and dry air better than most other house plants.
One thing it doesn't like is cold air. Keep your plant away from drafts and A/C vents and it'll do just fine.
</p>

<p>
Its large, pointed, green variegated leaves are 6-10 inches (15-25 cm) long, 3-6 inches (7.5-15 cm) wide, and heavily marbled with white, cream, silver or red.

    <li><b><i>Air Cleaners</i></b><li>
    <li><i>Chinese evergreens are among the best plants for removing toxins, such as formaldehyde, from tainted indoor air.
    As if their good looks weren't enough, their air-cleaning abilities make them must-have house plants.</i><li>
</ul>

<p><b>Water regularly.</b> Consistently moist soil will keep this plant happy. In fact, it can grow in water alone.
</p>

<p><b>Don't prune.</b> All new growth is from the crown of the plant, so don't prune it back or you'll kill it. If it begins to look leggy, plant pothos -
or some other low-light plant - in the same container to cover the bare stems.
</p>

<p><b>Is Chinese Evergreen poisonous?</b> Yes. Small flowers may appear in summer, followed by red berries.
Both the berries and the sap of this plant contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic.
It's not a good idea to keep Aglaonema where children and pets may play with or ingest it.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Chinese Evergreen is easy to propagate by stem cuttings. Take 3-4 in (7.5-10 cm) long stem tip cuttings in spring. Dip the cut ends in water then rooting powder.
Insert into sterile, moist potting mix. Keeping the plants warm and humid will improve successful propagation. Older root-bound plants can be divided.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light to low light. Keep it out of direct sunlight, which may cause its leaves to fade.
Aglaonema grows well under fluorescent light, making it an ideal office plant.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water Chinese Evergreen thoroughly, then allow surface of potting medium to dry out a bit before watering again.
Keep it slightly drier in winter, when growth is slower.
Don't allow it to get so dry that its leaves wilt. When watering, try to keep the leaves dry to prevent leaf spots.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Chinese Evergreen is not a big feeder. From spring through summer, feed monthly with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble houseplant fertilizer,
using half the recommended amount. Do not feed in winter, when growth is slow.
