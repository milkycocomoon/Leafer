<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This bushy plant has thick stems that grow upright at first, then trail over the sides of a container.
Put it in a hanging basket to show off its thickly leaved cascading stems.
</p>

<p>
Swedish ivy has rounded leaves that are deeply veined with scalloped edges. P. australis is a variety with solid green foliage.
The variegated types are more commonly grown as house plants.
</p>

<p>
Does Swedish Ivy bloom? Yes. You can expect pale lavender or white flowers to appear in spring or summer, but they're not nearly as showy as the foliage.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch and prune.</b> This vigorous grower needs regular pruning to keep it in shape. After the flowers fade,
snip off stem tips to encourage branching. You'll get a fuller, bushier plant this way. Propagate the stem tips, if you like.
They root easily and will provide an ongoing collection of new plants.
You can prune your plant back by as much as half at a time - you won't hurt this robust plant at all.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering when to repot?</b> Move it up when the plant is crowded in its pot.
Spring is the best time, when Plectranthus begins its most vigorous time to growth. Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> Watch for fungus gnats that are attracted to wet, peaty potting mixes.
Also check for mealybugs and spider mites. Isolate any infested houseplant and treat it right away with insecticidal soap.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take stem cuttings in spring or summer. They'll root easily in water or moist potting mix.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. Some morning sun is fine. Plants that don't get enough light will have leggy stems with wide gaps between leaves.
Move your ivy to a brighter spot, but keep it out of harsh, direct sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Swedish Ivy grows best with evenly moist soil spring through fall. Take care not to allow the soil to become soggy, which can cause root rot.
If your plant wilts despite regular watering, it is probably suffering from root rot.
If this happens, take a few stem cuttings from the healthiest stems and propagate them. Get rid of the parent plant - it won't recover.
Water sparingly winter, when growth has slowed, but don't allow it to dry out completely.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer (such as 10-10-10 N-P-K). Do not feed in winter when growth is slow.
