<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This stemless succulent grows in a rosette of fleshy, upright green leaves with sharp, pointed tips.
</p>

<p>
The markings vary by species and may be striped or spotted.
H. pumila is a popular variety featuring pearly white "warts" on its leaves, giving this species the common name <i>"Pearl Plant".</i>
Haworthias are small, making them beautiful additions to succulent and cactus dish gardens.
</p>

<p>
Some species may flower. The blooms are small and grow in clusters on long stems.
</p>

<p><b>Watch that water.</b> When watering, avoid getting the leaves wet. Like other succulents, its leaves are prone to rot.
</p>

<p><b>Give it a winter rest.</b> Growth slows down in winter, when light levels are lower.
Water less in winter and keep your Haworthia houseplant slightly cooler. Stop feeding till spring.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> Mealy bugs are the most common pest on succulents and cacti.
They are tiny, white and fuzzy, looking like specks of white cotton.
Keep an eye out for these insects, which may be anywhere on the plant - stems, leaves, and even around the roots.
Treat any infestation immediately because they multiply quickly and may move on to your other houseplants.
Pick them off the plant, if you can. Or use insecticidal soap.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in late spring.</b> It's a good idea to repot every year or two because they shed their old roots each spring,
and giving them fresh potting mix will keep the plants healthy. You'll probably want to propagate offsets at that time anyway.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Remove offsets that grow around the plant in spring and pot in their own containers.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright indirect light. Unlike most succulents, haworthias don't like direct sun,
which can make the leaves shrivel or cause brown scorch marks.
If you move your plant outdoors for the summer months, make the move a gradual one and keep it shaded.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Allow soil to almost dry out between waterings. Try to avoid getting the leaves wet because they may rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with a fertilizer specially made for succulents. Don't feed in winter when growth is slow.
