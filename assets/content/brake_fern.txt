<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Pteris is easier to please indoors than some other ferns.
Brake Fern does require bright light, so don't put it in a dark corner.
Set this handsome foliage plant on a table or plant stand near a window to give it the sunlight it craves.
</p>

<p>
Its fronds are somewhat fragile, so it's a good idea to keep this fern where passersby won't brush against its foliage.
</p>

<p>
Many different varieties are available and they vary in leaf shapes and variegations.
There are dozens of cultivars available. Choose what tickles your fancy - all make captivating accents for a room.
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Pteris cretica 'Albolineata'</i> sports creamy white stripes down the center of its leaflets</li>
<li><i>P. ensiformis 'Victoriae'</i> has silvery white stripes, giving it the common name Silver Brake Fern</li>
<li><i>P. Cretica 'Cristata'</i> has long, slender leaflets with frilly tips</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Drooping, wilted fronds</b>are likely caused by underwatering.
It's a good idea to use a container with drainage holes so you can water your fern thoroughly, avoiding any dry pockets in the soil.
</p>

<p><b>Pale leaflets</b> are a symptom of too much sunlight.
Move your houseplant away from the window.
Don't worry about this - your Brake Fern will green up again after a few weeks in a shadier spot.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> only when it gets too crowded.
Brake Fern is slow-growing and prefers to be pot-bound.
Keep the crown of the plant above the soil line when repotting.
Don't pack the soil down; this fern likes a little air around its roots. Use a pot with a drainage hole to avoid soggy soil.
</p>

<p><b>Prune it.</b> Keep it compact by cutting off tall fronds at the base.
New ones will grow to take their place.
</p>

<p><b>Keep it cool.</b> Cool nights and moist air will keep this small fern healthy indoors.
Hot, dry air will make the fronds turn yellow. Cut off yellow fronds at the base.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division. Divide large plants in spring only when crowded; this fern is slow-growing and rarely needs divided.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Give your fern bright (indirect) light year-round. It also thrives under fluorescent light.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the potting mix lightly moist at all times.
This Mediterranean fern needs slightly less water than its rainforest cousins, so take care not to overwater.
Soggy potting medium will lead to root rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Brake ferns aren't heavy feeders, but they do need a regular weak water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season.
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced house plant fertilizer at half the manufacturer's recommended strength.
