<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Known botanically as <i>Agapanthus africanus</i>, African lily is a clump-forming, perennial plant with long, lance-shaped leaves.
One rare variety is <i>'Variegatus'</i>, sporting striped leaves.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the tall flower stems are rounded umbels of showy, 6-petaled flowers. Each bloom is about 1-1/2" (4 cm) long.
Though most African Lilies are blue, lavender or purple, <i>'Albus'</i> has flower heads of pure white.
</p>

<p><b>Pot 'em up.</b> Each plant sends up several leafless flower stems, surrounded by a fountain of long,
sword-shaped leaves and needs room to grow. Plant rhizomes 1-inch (2.5 cm) deep.
It's best to plant one per pot because plants eventually spread out at least 1 ft (30 cm) wide.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> only when necessary.
This flowering plant blooms best when pot-bound, so keep the fleshy rhizome roots crowded in the container.
Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil.
</p>

<p><b>Deadhead spent flower stems.</b> After African Lily has finished blooming for the season,
cut the flower stems near the base of the plant. Remember to always use sharp, clean pruners on your plants.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering whether to cut African Lily back?</b> Agapanthus africanus is an evergreen type that doesn't need pruning.
It can be left alone, unless you want to cut off the occasional brown leaf to tidy it up.
</p>

<p><b>Overwinter A. africanus</b> in a sunny window. It's an evergreen and wants sunlight all year long.
African Lily will tolerate cool temperatures, but don't expose your plant to 50°F/10°C or lower.
Reduce watering during the winter months, but don't allow the soil to dry out.
Stop fertilizing after flowering is over. In early spring, resume normal care.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Divide plants in spring every 4 years or when they get too crowded.
Sow African lily seeds in spring. Plants grown from seed may take 2 to 3 years to flower.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
African lilies thrive in full sunlight. If you don't get many blooms, move your plant to a sunnier location.
Moving African lily outdoors for the summer will give it the sunlight it needs.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water generously throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist. Water sparingly after flowering is finished.
It's a good idea to use a pot with drainage holes because African Lily won't tolerate soggy soil.
Yellow leaves are usually a sign of overwatering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with a high-phosphorous water-soluble fertilizer.
