<h3>General</h3>
<p>
The blooms are spectacular, with 4 flared sepals (that's the top part of the bloom) often in a contrasting color to the bell-shaped petals.
The petals may be single, semi-double or double, with stamens and pistils extending from the blooms.
Thousands of hybrids offer rich colors to choose from - in any combination of white, pink, red, lavender, or purple.

<p><b>Shed some (indirect) light.</b> Fuchsias make easy indoor plants, if you can provide the bright light they need to grow.
Place your fuchsia plant near a window, where it'll get filtered sunlight.
Moving your plant outdoors for the summer will really help it to thrive.
Just keep it in a shady spot and be sure to bring it back inside when the temperature drops below 45°F/7°C at night.
Fuchsias won't tolerate frost.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch your plant.</b> In spring and early summer, pinch off growing tips to encourage the plant branch out.
You'll have a fuller fuchsia plant this way. You can propagate those stem tips, if you want, for more plants.

<ul>
<li><b><i>Pruning tip</i></b></li>
<li><i>Prune stems in early spring to promote vigorous new growth and to give your plant and attractive shape.
Take care not to cut off any flower buds while pruning. Use sharp pruners and cut at a 45° angle above a leaf axil.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Give it a rest.</b> Fuchsias go dormant in winter. Keep your plant in a cool place (with a minimum of 45°F/7°C).
Cut back on watering during this time, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.
</p>

<p><b>Repot every spring.</b> Fuchsia plant blooms best when slightly pot-bound, and it has shallow roots,
so don't be in a big hurry to move it to a larger pot.
When the plant reaches the size you want, you can repot it in the same container, just to refresh the soil.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3 in (7 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root in moist potting mix.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light, but no direct sun.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly spring through fall, keeping the soil evenly moist.
Plants in hanging baskets dry out quickly, so check them often especially if they're outside.
Cut back on watering in the winter, while the plant is dormant.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
