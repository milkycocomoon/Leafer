<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Florist Chrysanthemum has big, beautiful flowers crowning a mass of dark-green foliage.
Native to China, this is a member of the Asteraceae family, along with daisies, sunflowers and marigolds.
</p>

<p>
Chrysanthemum gets its name from the Greek words chryos, meaning gold, and anthemom, meaning flower.
These "golden flowers" are now available in shades of pink, purple, red, burgundy, white, and yes - golden yellow.
</p>

<p>
How big does this indoor Chrysanthemum get? It's typically at a height 12-24 in (30-60 cm) tall;
however, commercial growers treat plants with chemicals to stunt their growth, keeping them compact.
</p>

<p><b>Buds won't open?</b> Give your plant plenty of sunshine to ensure blooming.
Flowering plants may look cheerful near an inside wall or in a sunless hallway, but they won't bloom well there. Give them light.
</p>

<p><b>Wilted plants are likely thirsty.</b> Florist mums are often root-bound - their pots are packed with roots,
with little soil to hold water. You can revive dry roots by setting the pot in a pan of water for at least 30 minutes,
allowing it to drink up, while also watering from the top. Keep a close eye on mums; you may need to water every day or two.
</p>

<p><b>Are mums toxic?</b> Yes - Chrysanthemum leaves are poisonous.
Keep out of the reach of children and pets that may play with or ingest this plant.
</p>

<p>Give your plant a cool, bright location, and you can expect blooms for about 6 to 8 weeks.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to get mums to rebloom, so it is treated as an annual and tossed out after the blooming season is over.
You can put your plant outdoors in the spring to possibly get another season of blooms, but it will never look as good.
</p>

<p>Although temporary houseguests, beautiful florist chrysanthemums work hard at removing air pollutants found in homes caused by the chemicals in upholstery, paint and carpet.
Florist mums are one of the best flowering plants for purifying indoor air of formaldehyde, benzene and ammonia.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Easy propagation method, and one that produces far more plants, is by cuttings.
Cuttings can be taken in the late spring and early summer, and are best taken in the morning before the heat of the day and when the shoots are turgid.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light. Flower buds may fail to open without enough sunlight.
Direct morning light is fine, but keep your mums out of direct afternoon sun because they can't take the heat.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist at all times. Foliage will wilt and flower buds won't open if the roots are too dry.
Flowering plants are thirsty, so check the soil often.
