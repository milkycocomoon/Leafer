<h3>General</h3>
<p>
New leaves emerge from the center of the plant, eventually growing about 10 inches (25 cm) long.
It's a lush, full plant that needs a little fussing over to thrive indoors.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves</b> are likely caused by dry air.
This South American native thrives in high humidity.
Short of turning your home into a misty rain forest, you do have a few options here.
Bathrooms are sometimes a good location for tropical plants because of the high humidity;
but only if it has enough light streaming in. A room humidifier works wonders, especially during the winter months,
when indoor air can become extremely dry.
</p>

<p><b>Dry, brown scorch marks</b> on leaves are caused by hot, direct sunlight.
Keep your Calathea orbifolia in bright light, but out of direct sun.
</p>

<p><b>Leaves not unfolding?</b> Calatheas that keep their leaves folded up night and day are likely too dry.
This rain forest native likes moisture - don't forget to water and maintain humidity around it.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering when to repot?</b> When your Calathea is crowded in its pot,
the crown of the plant is pushing up out of the potting mix, or when you see roots growing out of the drainage holes,
it is definitely time to repot. Spring is the best time, when your plant is beginning its most vigorous time of growth.
Wait about a month before feeding a newly repotted plant; some roots will likely break while repotting and may get fertilizer burn.
</p>

<p><b>Webbing between leaves</b> is often the first tell-tale sign of spider mites.
Unfortunately, these tiny critters will do a lot of damage, sucking sap from the undersides of the leaves.
Left untreated, they multiply rapidly, causing leaves to look dry, and mottled with yellow spots.
Spider mites prefer warm, dry conditions. Maintaining high humidity around Calathea orbifolia will do double-duty,
giving this tropical plant the moisture it craves and discouraging an attack.
</p>

<p>
Consistently moist peat-based potting mixes attract fungus gnats. You may find these tiny,
fly-like pests hopping and crawling on the surface of the potting mix.
They're not particularly destructive, but they multiply quickly and will move on to your other indoor plants.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division; divide large plants in spring. Calathea orbifolia can be divided if it has grown an offset plant
(one that has a separate stem with leaves attached).
Here's how to divide it: Pull the whole plant out of its pot, then gently separate the offset plant,
keeping as much of the roots attached as possible; pot up the new offset in its own pot.
Add more potting mix as needed and water thoroughly.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Moderate to bright, indirect sunlight. Hot, direct sun will cause leaves to turn brown.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Aim to keep the potting mix lightly moist; never allow it to dry out.
It's a good idea to pot Calathea orbifolia in a container with drainage holes. Water thoroughly,
then empty the drainage tray to prevent root rot. Avoid overwatering, which will cause crown rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer.
