<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This beautiful tree starts out as a thick tuft of spiky leaves.
As it grows, the lower leaves naturally fall, leaving a cluster of dramatic, spear-shaped leaves above a bare woody stem.
Its narrow, red-edged leaves can grow about 12-16 in (30-40 cm) long.

Dracaena care is easy. Dragon tree thrives in average room conditions, tolerating dry indoor air and low light levels that are deadly to most plants.
This dynamic house plant also handles changing temperatures and humidity levels.
Just don't overwater. It will not tolerate soggy soil, which can cause root rot.
</p>

<p><b>Clean it up.</b> Those tall, upright leaves tend to be dust-catchers. If possible,
take the plant outdoors when the weather permits and gently spray the leaves with tepid water. Or wipe them off with a damp cloth.
</p>

<p><b>Keep it short.</b>  Slow-growing, this exotic house plant will eventually reach 6 ft (1.8 m) tall indoors.
You can control its height by simply cutting off the top.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> when roots become coiled in the container or grow out of the drainage holes.
Always use fresh potting mix when you repot a plant; old potting mixes become compact over time and nutrients become depleted.
Take care not to bury the stems - keep the plant at the same soil level as before to prevent stem rot. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent root rot.
</p>

<p><b>Winter care:</b> Dragon tree is an evergreen that won't go dormant,
but growth will slow down during the fall and winter months because of fewer daylight hours.
Reduce watering and stop fertilizing, then you can resume normal care in spring.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Cut sections of the cane into 4-6-inch (10-15 cm) pieces and root them like stem cuttings.
For best results, dip cut ends in rooting hormone powder before setting them in potting medium.
Use a sterile medium, such as seed starting mix, or a half-and-half mix of peat moss-based mix and horticultural sand.
Keep potting medium lightly moist and warm for roots to develop.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight in summer, which may cause dry, brown patches on leaves.
Give your Dragon Tree a quarter turn every week to expose all sides to light for even growth.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall, slightly drier in winter. Do not let soil get waterlogged, which can cause root rot.
Drooping, yellow leaves are a sign of root rot. Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy potting soil.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced (10-10-10) liquid fertilizer diluted by half.
Don't forget to feed your tree - pale leaves are sometimes caused by too little fertilizer.
