<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This is a plant that really knows how to show off. Big, round clusters of small flowers cover mophead hydrangeas all summer in blue,
violet-blue, white, pink or red.
New cultivars are introduced with bi-colored blooms, and in more vibrant colors than we've ever seen.
</p>

<p>
Hydrangea <i>'Endless Summer'</i> produces an abundance of pale-blue blooms.
It's one of the hardiest - good to know if you live in a cold climate and plan to move your plant outdoors.
More popular varieties include violet-blue <i>'Nikko Blue'</i>, deep-blue <i>'All Summer Beauty'</i> and snowy white <i>'Libelle'</i>.

<p><b>Keep the soil moist.</b> Dry soil can be the death of this plant. Leaves that turn yellow and fall off are a sign of dry soil.
Flowering plants are thirsty, so it's a good idea to check the soil every day while in bloom.
</p>

<p><b>Hydrangea pruning.</b> Mophead hydrangeas don't need to be pruned back unless you want to control their size.
Cutting off about 1/3 of the oldest stems will give you a fuller plant. Use clean, sharp  pruners to cut the stem at a 45Â° angle, 1/4-inch after a leaf axle.
When to prune hydrangeas: After blossoms fade. Hydrangea shrubs are perennials. Woody stems are densely covered with big, oval leaves that are deep green.
</p>

<p><b>Overwintering your plant.</b> Hydrangea shrubs are perennials.
If you intend to keep your plant, repot after flowering is over and cut the woody stems back by half. Water sparingly in winter.
Keep the plant cool during the winter, then move it to warmer conditions in late winter to help bring it into bloom.

<ul>
<li><b><i>How to Keep Blue Hydrangeas Blue</i></b></li>
<li><i>Blue hydrangeas need acidic soil (pH 5.5 and lower) or they will change flower color from blue to pink.
Alkaline soils (higher than pH 7) are fine for pink varieties. To keep the blue color, add sulphur while the plant is blooming.
Neutral pH (between pH 5.5 and pH 7) can make the flowers purple or a mix of pink and blue.</i></li>
<li><i>It's important to know that not all cultivars can change to blue, so buy the color you want and try to maintain it.
It's much easier to maintain a color than to change it completely by experimenting with soil acidity.
Besides, some varieties won't change no matter what you do.</i></li>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 4 inch (10 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and root them in moist potting mix.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Provide at least 4 hours of bright, indirect light every day.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy while plant is growing and flowering.
Pots are usually packed tightly with roots, so water often.
Use lime-free water because lime will make the soil alkaline. Water sparingly in winter, when hydrangea is resting.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced fertilizer (such as 10-10-10) diluted by half.
Or, use a slow-release fertilizer once in spring and again in summer. Go easy - too much fertilizer may scorch its leaves.
