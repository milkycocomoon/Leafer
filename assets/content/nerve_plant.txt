<h3>General</h3>
<p>
In its native South America, this tropical plant grows as a ground cover and can spread out about 12 inches (30 cm).
Its low-spreading habit makes it ideal for dish gardens and terrariums, where it thrives with the help of high humidity.
</p>

<p>
This plant grows best with even temperatures around 70°F/21°C.
It doesn't like dry air, drafts, or direct sun, any of which may cause its leaves to shrivel or fall off.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch your plant.</b> Pinch off stem tips regularly to keep plant bushy and full.
Also pinch off any small flower spikes that may appear, because they are insignificant and will weaken the show of leaves.
</p>

<p><b>Mist it.</b> This tropical beauty loves to be misted.
Give it a fine spray of tepid water every morning to provide the moist air it craves.
Or place the pot on a tray of wet pebbles to raise the humidity around it.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> every couple years to refresh the soil. Nerve Plant has shallow roots, so you can keep it in a small pot.
</p>

<p><b>Yellow leaves</b> are a symptom of too much water. Too-frequent watering or poor drainage will cause foliage to turn yellow.
Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil that can lead to root rot.
</p>

<p><b>Leaf drop</b> is likely caused by cold temperatures or drafts from nearby windows.
This tropical native prefers the same warm temperatures that you do.
</p>

<p><b>Dry, shriveled leaves</b> are a sign of dry air or direct sun exposure.
Room humidity can drop drastically in the winter months.
Use a room humidifier, if needed, and keep your plant out of direct sunlight.
</p>

<p><b>Pests and diseases</b> sometimes arrive with a new plant.
It's a good idea to look over your houseplants regularly for insects, sticky honeydew or sooty mold.
Aphids are the most common pest for a young plant, because they feed on new growth.
Treat any infestation immediately and isolate any affected plant to prevent pests from moving on to your other indoor plants.
