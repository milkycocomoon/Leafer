<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Thick, upright stems carry arrow-shaped leaves with scalloped edges. Bold silver-green veins make a dramatic pattern on glossy, dark-green leaves.
</p>

<p>
Alocasias grow from rhizomes, which can be divided in spring for more plants. Each rhizome produces several leaves that grow to 1 ft (30 cm) long.
</p>

<p>
Just like other members of the Araceae family, its flowers are composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe.
On this plant, however, they are insignificant. It's the spectacular foliage that makes this tropical native well worth growing.
</p>

<p>
This tropical house plant can be somewhat fussy, preferring the high humidity of a greenhouse to an average home.
However, a room humidifier and frequent misting of the leaves will give it the moist air it craves.
Regular misting also helps to keep away red spider mites that are attracted to dry conditions.
</p>

<p>
Give your plant a rest period in winter, allowing the soil to become almost dry between waterings and stop fertilizing.
It may go dormant if it dries out completely. But don't give up on it - it'll recuperate in a month or two with good care.
Continue to provide plenty of humidity with a pebble tray or a cool-mist humidifier.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division. Divide rhizomes in spring and pot in separate containers.
Keep the top surface of the rhizome above the soil line so that the growing stems don't rot at soil level.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light, but no direct sun.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil moist spring through fall when plant is actively growing. Water sparingly in winter, allowing soil to become almost dry between waterings.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half. Do not feed in winter.
