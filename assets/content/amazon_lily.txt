<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This evergreen hybrid has deeply veined, glossy leaves that grow up to 1 ft (30 cm) long.
</p>

<p>
It's a beautiful plant even when not in bloom.
But the star-shaped, snowy-white flowers that appear in summer are a sight to behold - and fragrant, too.
</p>

<p>
Amazon Lily flowers resemble narcissus, featuring a cup in the center of each bloom, tinged with green.
The flowers are about 3 in (8 cm) wide and grow in clusters on thick, upright stems that may need staking to hold them up.
You can expect 3 or more flowers per stem.

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> every 3 years or when it's practically bursting out of its pot.
This lily thrives in a small container and blooms best when pot-bound.
Just be sure to use one with drainage holes to prevent overwatering. Remove offset bulbs at this time and pot them separately.
</p>

<p><b>Give it a rest.</b> After blooming, cut back on water to allow the bulb to dry out and stop fertilizing till spring.
Then resume with normal care. Sometimes the plant will bloom a second time in fall or winter.
If not, you can expect it to rebloom the following summer.
</p>

<p><b>No flowers?</b> Amazon Lily may not bloom for a year after it is repotted.
Remember, the bulbs bloom best when they are crowded.
It's a good idea to pot about 5 bulbs in a 6- or 8-inch pot to keep them snug. They also need warmth and indirect sunlight to bloom.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your plant?</b> Kept indoors, Amazon Lily may not be bothered by pests.
Scale insects and spider mites are the most common.
Isolate any affected plant and treat it right away to prevent bugs from moving on to your other houseplants.
Raising the humidity during the winter months will help to prevent spider mites, which prefer dry, warm conditions.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Detach offset bulbs and pot them separately. Plant the bulb with the nose just barely covered.
Water the newly potted bulb sparingly until new growth begins.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light but no direct sun.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water generously throughout the growing season, keeping the soil evenly moist but not soggy, which can cause bulbs to rot.
Water sparingly after flowering is over, when plant is resting.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
