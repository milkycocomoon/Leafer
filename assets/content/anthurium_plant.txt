<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Anthurium andreanum, also known as tail flower, is especially colorful from spring through fall.
Anthurium flowers are long-lasting, and newer cultivars will bloom almost year-round.
</p>

<p>
The glossy red, heart-shaped flowers are actually spathes that last for several weeks,
each with a white or yellow spadix covered densely with its tiny, true flowers.
Some varieties have spathe colors that are pink, orange-red or white.
</p>

<p>
Long, dark-green leathery leaves grow up to 8-in (20 cm) long, held on upright stems. <b>Anthurium leaves are poisonous.</b>
They contain calcium oxalate crystals that cause severe burning in the mouth.
Keep the plant away from pets who may play with or chew on its foliage.
It's also a good idea to wear gloves when handling this plant to avoid skin irritation.
</p>

<p><b>Raise the humidity.</b> Because of the need for humidity, Anthurium growing can be challenging in the home.
However, newer cultivars are less fussy than the species.
If the relative humidity drops below 50%, use a humidity tray or room humidifier to increase the moisture in the air.
Grouping plants also helps to maintain the humidity around them. Brown leaf tips may be a sign of dry air.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring.</b> Move into a pot that's only 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) bigger - and only when necessary.
Set the plant high so that the crown sits above the soil line.
If roots show up at the surface between repottings, cover them with potting mix.
Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil; good drainage is essential.
</p>

<p><b>Keep it clean.</b> Anthurium leaves are naturally glossy. Wipe them gently with a damp cloth to keep them dust-free.
Avoid dripping water on the leaves because it may cause brown spots, a fungus that needs to be treated with a fungicide.
</p>

<p><b>Yellow leaves</b> are typically a symptom over-watering, but may be caused by cold drafts.
This South American native wants warmth, year-round.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Divide crowded clumps when repotting.
When a plant grows a new crown near the main plant, gently pull it away and plant it separately in a small container,
keeping the crown of the plant above the soil line. New plants should bloom in about a year.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light will make these beauties bloom.
Give your plant as much sunlight as you can year-round (at least 4 hours of bright indirect light each day).
Keep Anthurium out of direct sun, which may cause dry, brown patches on its leaves. A curtain-filtered sunny window is ideal.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall, slightly drier in winter. Yellow leaves are often caused by over-watering.
Use a pot with drainage holes, water thoroughly, then empty drainage tray.
Don't allow soil to get soggy, which can kill this plant.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer.
