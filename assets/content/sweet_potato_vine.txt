<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Mounds of dense, colorful foliage make sweet potato vine a favorite ornamental. It's  also fast-growing and practically care-free.
</p>

<p>
Known botanically as <i>Ipomoea batatas</i>, this decorative sweet potato vine has origins in Central America.
</p>

<p>
Sweet potato leaves offer bold color from spring through fall. You don't need to overwinter - treat this tender vine as an annual.
There is one draw-back with this vigorous vine. It has a tendency to take over any space available. It will crowd other plants if you let it.
</p>

<p>
How big does it get? It will grow up to 12 in (30 cm) tall, and will spread or trail several feet, if not cut back.
</p>

<p>
Don't be afraid to prune sweet potato vines back as much as needed to keep it under control. And don't throw away those cuttings, either.
They'll root easily if you poke them into moist soil.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering where to grow sweet potato plant?</b>
Its trailing habit makes ornamental sweet potato vine ideal for a warm, sunny windowsill.
Plant it in a hanging basket - or a window box - and let its lush vines spill over the side.
Or use it as an underplanting for tall flowers outdoors.
</p>

<p>
Tie it to a trellis, if you want. Those long vines won't climb, so they need some help from you.
Use florist ties to tie the weeping stems to a trellis or other support.
A trellis makes a gorgeous backdrop for tall, upright plants in contrasting colors.

<p>

Popular cultivars include chartreuse <i>'Marguerite'</i>, dark-purple <i>'Blackie'</i> and purple <i>'Sweet Caroline'</i>.
Newer cultivars are cropping up with exciting color combinations.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Stem tip cuttings will dependably grow roots. Cut stem tips anytime during the growing season.
Then, stick the cut ends in fresh, moist potting mix - or put them in a glass of water.
Keep the cuttings warm, watered and in bright, indirect sunlight. Sweet potato vines will root in about 2 to 3 weeks.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Moderate to bright light. Will tolerate some direct sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist at all times. This fast-growing vine is thirsty and dries out quickly in a container, so check it often.
Use a container with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil which can lead to root rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly in spring, summer and fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer.
