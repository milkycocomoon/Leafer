<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Funnel-shaped freesia flowers are sweetly-scented and available in single- and double-flowered varieties.
Hybrids offer a big range of gorgeous colors - lavender, pink, orange, red, yellow, white and bicolors.
Surrounding the flower stems are long, strap-like leaves.
</p>

<p>
Freesia bulbs are actually corms, and are easy to grow indoors.
Native to South Africa, they are warm-natured, meaning corms don't need a cold treatment to bloom; the corms are ready to plant.
</p>

<p>
Start planting freesia in late summer or early fall for winter or early-spring blooms.
You can pot them up every couple weeks for a succession of flowers to enjoy for months.
</p>

<p>
After all the flowers are spent, reduce watering and allow the foliage to die back naturally.
When the foliage turns brown, stop watering. Then cut them off.
Lift the corms out of the potting medium and store them in a dry, warm (80°F/17°C) place for at least 3 months.
Corms need at least a 3-month rest before they can be started again.
Any rotten or corky corms likely have dry rot and should be discarded.
</p>

<p><b>Leaning stems</b> are likely stretching toward the sunlight.
It's a good idea to turn the pot every few days, or as necessary, to expose all sides to light.
Also, it's not unusual to stake up flowering freesias because they get top heavy and flop over.
</p>

<p><b>Shriveled, quickly fading blooms</b> are caused by too-high temperatures.
Make freesia last longer by keeping the plant in a slightly cooler location.
Blooms will last for months if kept at a maximum of 65°F/18°C.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Repot corms each year, following steps below. Corms grow offsets that can be separated and potted.
</p>
<p><b>How to Grow Freesia</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Choose a shallow pot (at least 3 in/7 cm deep) with drainage holes in the bottom.
Fill the pot loosely with potting mix. Set corms 2 in (5 cm) apart, pointed end up.
Do not press the corms into the mix, keep it loose so the roots can grow through it easily.
Top corms with 1 in (2.5 cm) of additional potting mix.</li>
<li>2. Water minimally until you see new growth.</li>
<li>3. Move pot to a bright, warm (80°F/27°C) location such as a sunroom for about 8 weeks. Keep the medium barely moist.</li>
<li>4. When shoots reach about 2 in (5 cm) tall, move the pot to a cooler (60-65°F/16-18°C)
room in a bright window for a couple weeks until flower buds form. Turn the pot every couple days for even growth.
When in full bloom, keep freesias in a bright location out of direct sun to prolong the bloom.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect sunlight. Some cool, direct morning sunlight is fine.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil lightly moist. Don't overwater because it will cause the corms to rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks, beginning with the first show of flower buds till the end of flowering.
Use a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer.
