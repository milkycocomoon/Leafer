<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Candy Corn Plant will quickly get big if left to grow. How big will it get? Its stems will reach about 6 ft (1.8 m) or more, if not pruned back.
It's naturally branching, but you'll want to cut the vines back in spring to keep them compact and bushy.
</p>

<p>
The unusual, hairy, tubular flowers are reddish-orange with yellow tips.
The flowers are nearly an inch (2.5 cm) long and arise from the leaf axils on short stalks.
Give Candy Corn Plant the bright light it wants, and you'll enjoy a delightful show of blooms from summer through late fall.
This tropical flowering vine blooms in abundance for several months. Even young plants are eager to bloom.
</p>

<p><b>Few flowers?</b> Your Candy Corn plant isn't getting enough light. If you don't have a sunny window, use an indoor grow light.
Feed it with bloom-boosting fertilizer to give it extra oomph. You can move it outdoors for the summer if you like,
but be sure to bring it back indoors when the temperature drops in fall.
This is a frost-tender plant. In fact, this tropical native doesn't like cold temperatures at all.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> when you see roots growing out of the drainage holes of the pot.
Move up only 1 pot size (1- to 2-inches larger) because this flowering vine blooms best when it is slightly pot-bound.
Be sure to use a pot with a drainage hole in the bottom.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take non-flowering stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer and root in moist soil.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to full sun from a South- or West-facing window.
Moving your plant outdoors for the spring and summer will give it the sunshine it needs to grow and bloom.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep the soil evenly moist spring through fall. Water sparingly in winter when growth is slower.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a high-phosphorus fertilizer diluted by half.
