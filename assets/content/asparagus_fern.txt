<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Long, arching stems densely covered with short, needle-like leaflets give Asparagus Fern a delicate appearance.
Its feathery foliage blends in beautifully with other humidity-loving house plants.
</p>

<p>
Mature plants will bloom in summer with tiny, white-to-pale pink flowers hidden among the lush greenery.
Flowers are sometimes followed by clusters of green berries that turn red in the winter. These berries are poisonous if eaten.
</p>

<p>
<b>Prune it back.</b> Trim off older, bare stems in the spring to make room for new growth and to keep the plant looking its best.
</p>

<p>
<b>Repot in spring</b> Move to a pot only 1 size larger.
Allow 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) from the surface of the potting mix to the rim of the pot.
The fleshy, tuberous roots sometimes force the potting mix up as they grow.
</p>

<p>
<b>Leaf drop</b> is usually a symptom of too much sunlight - or,
more likely - dry soil. Keep your asparagus fern where it'll get filtered light.
Water regularly, but take care not to overwater. The plant's thick, tuberous roots store water and soggy soil can cause root rot.
</p>

<p>
<b>Is Asparagus Fern poisonous?</b> Yes
- according to the ASPCA, this member of the Liliaceae family is toxic to cats and dogs. Its red berries are the most toxic, causing stomach upset.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Asparagus fern is easy to grow from seeds. You can divide overcrowded plants in spring.
Ease the plant out of its container and divide the plant with a sharp knife, keeping as much of the thick, tuberous roots attached as possible.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light year-round. Give your plant a quarter turn every week or so for even growth.
If you don't have a window available, this indoor plant grows beautifully under artificial light. Set plant 8 to 12 inches below light source for 14 to 16 hours per day.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, allowing soil to dry out a little between waterings.
Water sparingly in winter, but do not allow soil to dry out completely or those needles will drop off.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced house plant fertilizer diluted by half.
