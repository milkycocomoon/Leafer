<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Growing in a thick mat of tiny, dark-green leaves on intertwining stems, its foliage is attractive on its own.
However, small, white flowers appear in summer only to be upstaged by bright, orange-red berries.
You can expect the fiery berries to completely cover the foliage and last for months.

<p>
Because of its need for cool temperatures and high humidity, Nertera granadensis can be difficult to please indoors.
</p>

<p>
Repot in spring only when it gets crowded, probably every couple years. Its creeping stems need contact with soil to keep growing.
This is a good time to divide the plant, if you want. Nertera granadensis has shallow roots and is easy to divide for more plants.
Because of its shallow roots, shallow pots will do.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division; gently pull apart clumps and plant them in separate containers. Can also be grown from seed or from tip cuttings in spring.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light; no direct sun. Hot direct sunlight will cause the berries to shrivel.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist at all times, but not soggy. Don't allow Nertera granadensis to dry out.
Shriveled leaves indicate the plant is thirsty. To prevent getting the leaves wet, try to water the soil and not the plant.
Or water from the bottom - use a pot with drainage holes and set the pot in a saucer of water; it will drink up water as needed.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed once a month in spring and summer, with a water-soluble fertilizer at half strength, while the berries are on the plant.
If you're watering from the bottom, add fertilizer to the water tray.
