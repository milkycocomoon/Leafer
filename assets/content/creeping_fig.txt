<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Creeping fig has small, heart-shaped leaves that densely cover its long stems. Its growing habits make it a versatile plant indoors.
To show off its thickly leafed vines, put this trailing, climbing, creeping ficus plant in a hanging basket.
</p>

<p><b>Yellow leaves?</b> You over-watered. Water thoroughly when potting mix is dry 1 inch down. Reduce water in the winter when growth has slowed.
</p>

<p><b>Brown, shriveled, crunchy leaves</b> may be caused by too much sunlight or too little water. Raise the humidity around your houseplant.
</p>

<p><b>Prune it back.</b> Creeping fig is fast-growing and needs some help from you to shape it or train it.
Prune off new stems regularly to encourage branching and to shape them as they grow.
Pruning up to one-third in spring will keep the plant compact.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring.</b> This creeping ficus houseplant prefers to be slightly pot-bound.
Repot every 3 years, moving to a pot 1 size larger or keep it in the same pot and just give it fresh potting mix.
Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent root rot.

<p>
This creeping ficus houseplant is also known as Ficus repens. The variegated cultivars are the most popular.

</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3-4 inch stem tip cuttings in spring and root in perlite or fresh potting mix.
Use rooting hormone powder to ensure the stems will quickly develop roots.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect sunlight is ideal for Creeping Fig. It will tolerate low light, but not direct sun.
Dry, shriveled leaves are caused by too much sun. This ficus houseplant responds well to growing under a grow light.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. Water less in winter, allowing the top of the potting medium to dry out before watering again.
Yellow leaves are a sign of over-watering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) liquid fertilizer diluted by half.
Stop feeding in winter, when growth is slower because of lower light levels.
