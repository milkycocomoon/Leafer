<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Corn plant care is easy, making it an ideal house plant. It's good for you too, because it naturally cleans the air.
This is one of the best house plants for removing indoor air toxins such as formaldehyde, ammonia, xylene and toluene.
</p>

<p>
This hardy Dracaena is an unbranched, tree-like plant with sword-shaped arching leaves.
Those dark-green leaves are 2 ft (60 cm) long and 4 in (10 cm) wide, and have a broad cream-to-yellow stripe down the middle.
</p>

<p>
Strongly scented flowers are occasionally produced on a plant grown in its native habitat. Older plants may flower indoors, but it's rare.
</p>

<p><b>Dropped leaves?</b> As it grows, corn plant will shed its lower leaves, leaving a bare stem with a cluster of leaves at its top.
New plants may drop a few leaves. This is normal. It needs time to adjust after the shock of being moved to a new home.
</p>

<p>
This easy-care house plant will tolerate many abuses, but be careful not to over-water or over-fertilize.
<b>Droopy, yellow leaves</b> are a sign it's overwatered and may indicate root rot.
Be sure to use a container with a drainage hole and never allow the plant to stand in water.
</p>

<p>
<b>Prune it back</b> in spring or early summer to control its growth. You can cut off the cane at any height.
It will sprout a new cluster of leaves from where it was cut.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring </b> only when the plant's roots have filled the container.
It is slow-growing and likely won't need repotted more than every 3 years.
This plant prefers to be slightly root-bound, so keep it in a smallish container -
a heavy container will prevent it from toppling because this plant can get top-heavy.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer and pot them in moist potting mix.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light. Will tolerate low light. Brown scorch marks on leaves are caused by hot, direct sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Spring through fall, keep the soil moist, but not soggy. In winter, allow top 2 in (5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
