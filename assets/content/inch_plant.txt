<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Its long, fleshy stems are densely covered with lance-shaped leaves that are about 2 in (5 cm) long.
Each green and purple leaf is marked with 2 broad silvery bands, and is dark purplish underneath.
</p>

<p>
Small, 3-petaled flowers may appear in spring, but they're not showy compared to the colorful foliage.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch and prune.</b> Pinch stems back to keep Inch Plant from getting too leggy.
The best time to prune is in spring and summer, during this plant's most vigorous season of growth.
You can easily propagate the stem cuttings for more plants. Older stems will naturally lose some of their leaves and can be cut off at the soil level.
</p>

<p><b>Watch for pests.</b> Aphids are small, greenish insects that are attracted to new growth, which this plant has in abundance.
Look for them on the stems of new shoots. Also watch for webbing between stems and on the undersides of leaves, a tell-tale sign of spider mites.
They're not common, but spider mites may infest houseplants during the winter months when indoor air is dry.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> only when Inch Plant outgrows its pot. Move to one just 1-2 inches larger because a pot that's too big will hold too much water.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaves</b> are caused by dry air or dry potting mix. Inch plant care includes regular watering and keeping the humidity high.
</p>

<p><b>Is Tradescantia poisonous?</b> Yes, this popular houseplant is toxic to cats, dogs and people.
Unfortunately, those long, trailing stems are attractive to cats - another good reason to pot it in a hanging basket, out of reach.
Handling this plant may also irritate skin for some people, so it's a good idea to wear gloves while pruning and repotting Inch Plant.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Easy to propagate from stem tip cuttings.
Take 3 in (7.5 cm) cuttings in spring or summer and place in moist soil. Cuttings will root in about 3 weeks.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright, indirect light. Long spaces between leaves are caused by too little light.
Pinch off leggy stems and move your plant to a brighter spot. Leaves will also lose their variegation if they don't get enough light.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil lightly moist in the growing season, slightly drier in winter.
Use a pot with drainage holes; water thoroughly till water comes out the bottom, then empty drainage tray.
With Inch Plant care should be taken not to allow soggy soil - a sure-fire way to kill it.
Stems that look wilted may be a sign of root rot. Cut off any withered stems and allow potting mix to dry out a bit before watering again.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks during spring and summer with a balanced (10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
Tradescantia is not a heavy feeder. Too much fertilizer can cause the leaves to lose their variegation.
