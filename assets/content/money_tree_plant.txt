<p><b>Don't overpot.</b> Use a smallish container because a too-big container will hold too much water.
Soggy potting mix is often the biggest problem with this plant, causing stem and root rot and yellowing/dropping leaves.

Plants often are in shock when moved to a new home because they are adjusting to a new environment.
Keep your plant away from heat/AC vents and cold drafts from windows and entryways.

<p><b>Dropped leaves</b> are also caused by relocation shock. If your new tree drops its leaves, don't give up on it.
They'll grow back with good care. Place your money tree in a bright location and leave it there.

<h3>Propagation</h3>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Money tree plant likes water in big gulps. Water thoroughly, until water comes out the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot,
then allow the top 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) to dry out between waterings.
Take care not to allow the potting mix to get soggy, which can cause root rot.
And avoid getting water on the trunk, which causes stem rot.
Cut back on water in the winter when growth slows, but don't allow Money tree plant to dry out.
