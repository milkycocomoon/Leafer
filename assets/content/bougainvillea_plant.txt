<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Big clusters of brightly colored bracts in pink, red, orange or purple cover the plant summer through fall.
The papery bracts surround 3 small, creamy white flowers.
Bracts are long-lasting, but the actual white flowers nestled in the bracts are short-lived.

Those long, arching branches are covered with thorns, so be careful when handling them. They can cause skin irritation, too.
It's a good idea to wear thick gloves when pruning or repotting this plant. Prune back harshly in fall, after flowers fade.
Pruning bougainvillea regularly will keep the plant small and prevent it from becoming leggy.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> when you see new growth.
Bougainvillea blooms best when slightly pot-bound, so move it to a pot 1 size larger only when necessary.
While repotting, take care not to expose the roots to air for a long time because they will dry out.
</p>

<p><b>No flowers?</b> Intense direct sunlight is needed for bougainvillea plants to bloom.
</p>

<p><b>Yellow leaves</b> are a symptom of overwatering. Bougainvillea plants need steady moisture at their roots, but are prone to root rot if left in soggy soil.
</p>

<p><b>Watch for bugs</b> Bougies seem to shrug off pests,
but may be invaded by aphids (that show up on new growth) or spider mites (they prefer dry conditions).
If you see any signs of pests, isolate your plant and treat any infestation immediately.
</p>

<p><b>Is bougainvillea poisonous?</b> The sap of this plant is mildly toxic and can cause skin irritation.
Its spiny stems are more of a problem; a prick from a thorn may cause a skin rash.
Wear thorn-proof gloves while pruning or repotting your plant to prevent scratches.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Spring is the best time to propagate stem cuttings because bougainvillea plant is beginning its most vigorous time of growth.
Take 4 in (10 cm) stem tip cuttings, dip the cut end in rooting hormone powder, then insert it in moist potting mix.
Use a seedling heat mat to maintain an even 70°F/21°C for best results. Cuttings should root in about 2 months.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Full sun. Give it at least 4 hours of direct sun each day. Bougies won't bloom without enough light.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, then allow the top 2 inches (5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings.
Plant bougainvillea in a pot with drainage holes. Empty drainage tray to prevent soggy soil, which can lead to root rot.
Overwatering will cause leaves to turn yellow and fall off. Keep slightly drier in winter.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall.
