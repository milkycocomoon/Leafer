<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Round leaves with a dark-green striped pattern give this eye-catching succulent its common name.
Pointed leaf tips give this South Africa native another name, <i>African Spear</i>. (Watch out for those points - they are sharp!)
</p>

<p>
The gray-green tubular leaves grow straight up or arch outward, depending on the cultivar, and are about an inch thick.
Upright leaves tend to be dust-catchers - gently wipe leaves with a damp cloth to keep them dust-free.
</p>

<p>
Does Snake Plant flower? Maybe. Creamy white, tubular blooms growing along a tall flower stalk may appear on mature plants.
If you're lucky enough to get the blooms, you'll love their beautiful fragrance. Cut off flower stalks after blooming has stopped.
</p>

<p><b>Limp leaves</b> are either caused by lack of sunlight or overwatering.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring,</b> only when plants get crowded and need dividing.
Keep the leaves at the same soil level as they were before; don't bury them which can cause them to rot.
Use a wide, heavy container to prevent toppling - this tall plant can get top-heavy.
</p>

<p><b>Something bugging your houseplant?</b> Watch for webbing between leaves, caused by spider mites.
They're attracted to dry conditions, which succulents like.
Also look for white, fuzzy mealybugs that often hide at the base of a plant.
Isolate an infested houseplant to prevent pests from invading your other indoor plants, and treat it right away.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaf tips or dry, brown patches</b> are symptoms of too much direct sunlight.
</p>

<p><b>Is Cylindrica Snake Plant poisonous?</b> Yes, according to the ASPCA, this succulent contains saponins, which is toxic to cats and dogs.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Division. Propagate Snake Plant by separating the "pups" (offsets) that grow at the base of the parent plant. Dividing them is easy.
Turn the pot on its side, then ease out the plant. Use a serrated knife to cut off the offsets and pot them up individually.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to full sun. If you move Sansevieria cylindrica outdoors for the summer, don't worry - it can take the heat.
But make the move into direct sunlight a gradual one to avoid scorching its leaves. Scorch marks look like gray or brown patches.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, then allow the potting mix to dry out before watering again.
Water the potting medium, taking care not to get water on the leaves, which will cause them to rot.
If the leaves turn yellow, or get soft and mushy at their base, the plant is overwatered.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with fertilizer specially made for succulent plants, mixed at half the recommended strength.
Don't feed in winter, when growth is slower.
