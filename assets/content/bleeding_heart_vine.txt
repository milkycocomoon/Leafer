<h3>General</h3>
<p>
A spectacular specimen when in bloom, but its lush, deep-green foliage is attractive on its own.
The oblong, leathery leaves have deeply textured veins and look like the leaves of a banana plant.
Give this plant plenty of room...its leaves grow to 18 in (46 cm) long.
</p>

<p>
This tropical beauty is covered with attractive deeply veined, ovate leaves.
Its glory, however, are the eye-catching red and white flowers that bloom profusely from spring through fall.
Made up of snowy white calyces, the blooms are somewhat heart-shaped.
Emerging from each calyx is a bright red flower with long stamens.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> only when it has outgrown its container.
Bleeding heart blooms best when it is slightly pot-bound, so move it up to a pot only 1 size larger.
Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil.
</p>

<p><b>Prune vines back</b> in spring, when bleeding heart vine is beginning new growth.
Flowers grow near the tips of new stems, so you'll get more blooms this way.
You can cut the vines back by as much as half, if you want, to keep the plant at a manageable size for growing indoors.
</p>

<p><b>Raise the humidity</b> if the relative humidity near the plant drops below 50%.
You can place the pot on a tray of wet pebbles. Or use a cool-mist room humidifier.
Raising the humidity also helps to prevent spider mites from invading.
Watch for these pests, especially in winter when indoor air tends to get dry.
</p>

<p><b>Give it a winter rest.</b> This tropical vine is an evergreen perennial,
but it may stop flowering in the fall and winter months and growth slows down.
Unlike the popular shade-loving Bleeding Heart Plant, this vining plant won't overwinter in the garden,
unless you live in a tropical climate. Give it warmth, humidity and bright, indirect sunlight year-round.
Water sparingly during this rest and stop fertilizing till spring when you see new growth on the plant.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Easy to propagate from stem cuttings. Take 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and root in equal parts all-purpose potting mix and perlite.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright indirect light. Bleeding heart is a prolific bloomer when it gets enough sunlight.
It blooms heavily in spring and summer. If it doesn't bloom much, move it to where it will get more light from a south- or west-facing window.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist spring through fall, while bleeding heart vine is growing and flowering.
Water sparingly in winter, but do not let it dry out completely.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer.
