<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Cigar plant features tubular, orange-red flowers rimmed with white and purple.
</p>

<p>
Its unusual blooms are simply captivating, making this small shrub fun to grow as a houseplant.
Give it plenty of sunlight and you can expect flowers to appear in abundance from early summer to late fall.
They're about 1 in (2.5 cm) long, growing singly from the axils of the leaves.
</p>

<p>
This evergreen sub-shrub is fast-growing, reaching its mature height in a year.
Narrow leaves are 2 in (5 cm) long and densely cover the woody stems.
You'll want to prune it quite a bit to keep it small and bushy, when growing Cigar Plant indoors.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> when this shrubby plant gets crowded. Take care not to over-pot;
move it up to a container 1- to 2-inches (2.5 to 5 cm) larger. Why? Cigar plants bloom best when their roots are a little snug.
Use a pot with drainage holes to prevent overwatering - stems will rot at the base if the soil gets too soggy.
A terra cotta pot is ideal, because it "breathes" allowing the soil to dry out faster.
</p>

<p><b>Dry, crunchy leaves that fall off</b> is often caused by cold drafts or dry air.
Keep cigar plant away from windows, doors, and heat/AC vents.
</p>

<p><b>Prune it back.</b> Cut the stems back by half in late winter to encourage new growth and more flower buds.
Make the cut just after a node - the place where a leaf is attached to a stem. Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems.
Regular pinching and pruning will help this small shrub keep its rounded shape.
Unfortunately, this vigorous grower will become straggly over time; plan on replacing Cuphea ignea after a couple years or so.
</p>

<p><b>Wondering how to overwinter cigar plant?</b>
Shorter daylight hours will cause the growth to slow down, but keep this sun-lover near a window where it'll get the most sunlight.
If you don't have window space available for it, a grow light will do.
Water less during the winter months, keeping the potting mix lightly moist. Stop fertilizing till spring, when new growth begins.
In late winter, you can prune it back.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Making more cigar plants is easy. Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in summer and root them in moist perlite.
Once rooted, transplant them in separate pots with fresh potting mix. Sow seeds in early spring, keeping them warm and moist.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to full sun. Moving your cigar plant outdoors for the spring and summer will give it the sunlight it needs to stay
healthy and produce the most flowers.
Bright light will make the leaves appear brighter and the leaf tips to turn an attractive reddish-purple.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Spring through fall, water thoroughly. Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings, but don't allow it to dry out completely.
Keep the soil slightly drier in winter when growth is slower.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
