<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Velvety, dark-green leaves with daringly bold veins make Anthurium clarinervium a stunning room accent.
Spectacularly heart-shaped, the dramatic leaves grow about 1-ft (30 cm) wide in its native habitat, but will likely stay smaller when grown indoors.
</p>

<p>
In its native rainforest habitat, Anthurium grows as an epiphyte (a plant that grows on other plants), clinging to tree branches with its aerial roots.
High humidity, frequent rains and free-flowing air help to keep this plant hydrated without staying soggy.
And it thrives in the same warm temperatures that we do.
</p>

<p>
This tropical native likes moderate to high humidity. If the relative humidity drops below 50%, set the plant on a humidity
tray or use a cool-mist room humidifier. Don't spray with a plant mister because the soft, thick leaves are prone to fungus.
Indoor air can become extremely dry during the winter months without our noticing it.
It's a good idea to use a humidity monitor near your houseplant, rather than guess. Dry air may cause brown leaf tips.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take stem cuttings and pot them separately in small pots.
Or separate offsets that grow around the plant, making sure the offset has at least 2 leaves and roots attached.
Spring is the best time to start new plants, when they begin their most vigorous growth.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light, but no direct sun. Hot, direct sunlight can cause scorch marks on the leaves that look like dry, brown patches.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly to ensure that all the roots are watered. Remember to empty the drainage tray; Anthurium won't tolerate soggy soil.
Wait till the top couple inches of potting mix is dry before watering again. Water less often in fall and winter, but don't allow potting medium to dry out.
Yellow leaves indicate over-watering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer. Stop feeding in fall and winter, when growth is slower.
