<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Given enough light, the Bottle Brush Plant will readily produce upright flower spikes in spring and summer.
It doesn't actually have petals. Each "bottle brush" flower is made up of bright-red stamens with yellow tips,
clustered on flower spikes up to 4 in (10 cm) long. At the top of each fuzzy spike is a tuft of leaves.
</p>

<p>
Each woody stem is covered top to bottom with long, narrow leaves.
The dark-green leaves are pointed at the tips and grow upward, giving this captivating plant a lean, elegant look.
They have a fragrant, lemony scent, giving this plant another common name: <i>Lemon Bottlebrush</i>.
</p>

<p><b>Let it bask in the sun.</b> It'll make an easy indoor plant, if you can provide the sunlight Bottle Brush needs to grow and bloom.
Place Bottle Brush Plant directly in front of a sunny window. Or move your plant outdoors for the summer, if you want.
Just be sure to bring it back inside when the nighttime temperature drops to 45째F/7째C. This Australian native won't tolerate the cold.
</p>

<p><b>Prune it.</b> Immediately after flowering is over, cut the plant back by half to keep it compact.
Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing at the stems, which can harm the plant.
</p>

<p><b>Give it a rest.</b> Callistemons need a winter rest. Keep the plant in a cool place (with a minimum of 45째F/7째C).
Cut back on watering during this time, keeping the soil only slightly moist.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring.</b> Bottle Brush Plant blooms best when slightly pot-bound, so move it to a slightly larger pot only every couple years or when needed.
When the plant reaches the size you want, you can keep it small by repotting it in the same container, just to refresh the soil.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3 in (7 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. Can also be sown by seed in spring.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Full sun. Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. Give Bottle Brush Plant as much light as you can year-round.
A sunroom or a sunny spot directly in front of a window is ideal.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly spring through fall and allow the soil to dry out between waterings.
Reduce watering in the winter, while Bottle Brush plant is resting.
It's drought-tolerant, so if in doubt about watering, keep it on the dry side.
Yellow leaves are a symptom of overwatering and may indicate root rot.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring and summer with high-potassium liquid fertilizer diluted by half.
