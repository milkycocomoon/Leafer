<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Satin Pothos is just as easy to grow as its relative, golden pothos (Epipremnum aureum).
Keep it warm and take care not to overwater this house plant. Cold drafts and soggy soil are two things it won't tolerate.
</p>

<p>
You'll see the best leaf color and variegation by keeping it in bright, indirect light.
You'll also keep the plant healthy by boosting the humidity around it.
In fact, its variegated foliage makes Satin Pothos a beautiful addition to a terrarium.
</p>

<p>
Big, heart-shaped leaves are dark-green and splashed with silvery gray, giving them a satin sheen.
Its compact growth habit makes Scindapsus pictus 'Argyraeus' a beautiful hanging basket plant.

<li><b><i>Pruning tip</i></b></li>
<li><i>Your plant will benefit from occasional pruning, which helps it to branch out and become fuller.
Spring is the best time to cut it back. Use sharp pruners to avoid tearing the stems.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Repot in spring</b> when the plant outgrows its pot.
Use a pot only 1-2 inches bigger, because a much larger container will hold too much water. It's a good idea to use a pot with drainage holes.
If you want to use a cachepot (decorative container without drainage holes), slip a plain nursery pot in the cachepot.
I put pebbles in the bottom of my cachepots to keep the inner pot above the drainage water.
</p>

<p><b>Brown leaf tips</b> are caused by dry air. <b>Yellow leaves</b> are a symptom of too much water.</p>

<p><b>Brown spots surrounded by yellow halos</b> indicate bacterial leaf spot. Cut off affected leaves.
Take care not to get the leaves wet when watering.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 4 inch (10 cm) tip cuttings in spring or early summer and insert them into moist peat moss based potting mix.
Cuttings root easily in about a month.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Give Scindapsus pictus bright, indirect light year-round.
Harsh direct sunlight will scorch its leaves, while too-little light will cause the leaves to lose their variegation.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly and allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Keep soil barely moist in winter.
Yellow leaves are a symptom of overwatering. Always use room-temperature water when watering houseplants an provide good drainage.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed monthly spring through fall with a 20-10-10 water-soluble fertilizer diluted by half.
