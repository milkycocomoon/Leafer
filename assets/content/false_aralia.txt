<h3>General</h3>
<p>
False Aralia has slender leaflets that grow in a circle at the tops of stems so that they look like fingers,
giving this house plant another common name: <i>Finger Aralia</i>.
</p>

<p>
New coppery brown foliage turns a dark, blackish-green as the plant matures.
Its narrow, serrated leaflets give this small tree a lacy appearance, adding elegance to a collection of tropical house plants.
</p>

<p>
How tall does it get? Although slow-growing,
this tropical plant will grow about 6 ft (1.8 m) tall when grown in a pot indoors. Mature plants make magnificent floor plants.
</p>

<p><b>Leaf drop.</b> False Aralia likes to stay put. Moving it to a new location may cause its leaves to drop.
It doesn't respond well to changes in light and temperature. Shedding leaves may also indicate that humidity is too low.
Stand the pot on a tray of wet pebbles or use a cool-mist room humidifier.
Raising the humidity also helps to prevent spider mites that may invade this plant.
</p>

<p><b>Pruning.</b> False Aralia is slow-growing and doesn't need pruned unless you want to control its height.
Over time, it will drop its lower leaves, revealing a single tree-like trunk.
If you want, you can keep it short and shrubby by cutting it back each year.
Don't be afraid to prune it to 6 inches (15 cm) from the soil level. Spring is the best time to cut it back.
New offsets will grow from the base of the plant.
</p>

<p><b>Repotting.</b> Repot in spring only when it has outgrown its pot, but use the smallest container that will hold its roots.
It grows best when its roots are confined. Taller plants should be potted in a heavy container to prevent toppling.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Seeds or stem tip cuttings. Take stem tip cuttings in spring.
For best results, dip cut end in hormone rooting powder before inserting in moist potting mix.
Cover with a plastic bag to raise the humidity around the cutting. Keep it warm and out of direct sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
For a lush, bushy plant, give False Aralia plenty of bright light, but no direct sun.
Too much sun exposure may cause leaf edges to turn brown. Don't have a sunny spot for it?
Grow False Aralia under a compact fluorescent (CFL) grow light.
Keep your plant around 8 inches (20 cm) below the light source for 12 hours a day.
You can make it easy on yourself by using a power strip with a timer to turn the grow light on and off at the same time each day.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly and allow top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings. Wilted leaves are a sign of overwatering.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks with a balanced water-soluble fertilizer (such as 10-10-10 NPK) diluted by half. In fall and winter, feed monthly.
