<p>Stunning silver-patterned leaves make Aluminum Plant well worth growing.</p>

<p>
Known botanically as Pilea cadierei, this is a fast-growing perennial plant.
It spreads rapidly in its tropical native habitat of Vietnam, where it grows as a groundcover.
</p>

<p>How big does Aluminum Plant get? It will grow up to 12 in (30 cm) in height.</p>

<p>
Does it flower? Yes. Tiny, light-colored flowers sometimes appear in summer.
Don't be afraid to pinch them off. They're insignificant compared to the foliage.
</p>

<p>
Its ovate green leaves are about 3 in (8 cm) long. Silvery streaks mark each leaf, adding a dramatic metallic design to its quilted texture.
These unusual patterns give this plant another common name, watermelon pilea.
</p>

<h3 id="propagation">Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. Cut the stem just below a node - the place where a leaf is attached.
Place the cut end in moist potting mix and cover the plant with a plastic bag to retain humidity.
For best results, use a heat mat to maintain an even 70°F/21°C temperature. Cuttings root easily in a month.
</p>

<h3 id="light">Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light. The foliage will lose its variegation if the light level is too low.
It's a good idea to place it in bright, filtered sunlight year-round.
</p>

<h3 id="watering">Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. Overwatering will cause leaves to wilt or fall off.
Use a pot with drainage holes and allow soil to dry out a little between waterings. Keep slightly drier in winter.
</p>

<h3 id="fertilizer">Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a balanced (such as 10-10-10 NPK) water-soluble fertilizer at half the recommended strength
