<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Coleus plant, also known as <i>Painted Nettle</i>, is often grown outdoors as an annual because it is frost-tender.
But it's easy to grow indoors if you can provide bright light.
</p>

<p>
Best known as a garden annual, coleus has stunning foliage, making it a worthwhile - although temporary - houseplant.
</p>

<p>
You can expect tall flower spikes in summer with clusters of tiny, white or blue flowers.
You can pinch off the flower spikes as soon as you notice them because they not only will detract from the beautiful foliage,
coleus plants will decline after they have bloomed.
</p>

<p>
Boundless varieties of coleus are available. Foliage colors include red, maroon, brown, cream, yellow,
orange and green in dramatic combinations and designs. Leaf edges may be scalloped or ruffled and have a contrasting color.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch your plant.</b> Coleus plants can get leggy. Pinch growing tips early and often to encourage them to branch out and stay bushy and full.
</p>

<p><b>Keep it moist.</b> Coleus leaves will wilt and may fall off if the soil is too dry.
You'll have a much healthier-looking plant if you keep the soil moist at all times.
</p>

<p><b>Dropped leaves?</b> Low light, dry soil or cold air can cause leaves to drop.
Don't worry - this vigorous plant will replace them when it gets what it wants.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Sow coleus seeds in spring. Cover seeds lightly with potting mix and maintain 75°F/24°C temperature.
Take 3 in (7 cm) coleus stem tip cuttings in spring or summer. Stem tip cuttings root easily in water or moist soil.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright indirect light. Some direct sun is okay, except intense summer sun which will scorch the leaves.
Too little light dulls leaf colors and may cause leaves to drop. Don't have a sunny spot?
Coleus plants respond beautifully to artificial light. Set plants 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) below light fixtures for about 12 to 16 hours a day.
Turn lights off at night to give them at least 8 hours of darkness. (Coleus plants need a good 8 hours of rest, too.)
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep soil evenly moist. Leaves will wilt if thirsty. Avoid getting the velvety leaves wet. Hard water will cause white spots and they won't come off.
Remember to always use room-temperature water when watering houseplants.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks spring and summer with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half.
