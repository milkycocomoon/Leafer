In its native tropical habitat, this firecracker plant flourishes in the year-round warm temperatures and high humidity.
<b>Dropped leaves</b> are sometimes a symptom of being exposed to cold air.
Keep this flowering plant away from windows, doors or A/C vents, where it may be exposed to blasts of cold air.
<b>If the leaf tips turn brown,</b> raise the humidity around it.
</p>

<p><b>Repot in spring.</b> Keep this flowering plant in a small pot because it blooms best when its roots are crowded.
Use a pot with a drainage hole to prevent soggy soil.
</p>

<p><b>Deadhead spent blooms.</b> After the last flower on any flower spike dies, cut off the flower spike.
Deadheading will promote more flowers.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3 in (7.5 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring and pot them separately.
Keep cuttings warm, lightly moist, and give them indirect sunlight. Crossandra infundibuliformis can also be grown from seed.
Sow seeds in spring, barely covering them with moist potting mix. Use a seedling heat mat to maintain an even 70°F/21°C.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light. Some direct morning sun is fine, but keep shaded from hot midday sunlight.
Plants that don't bloom aren't getting enough light. Move the plant to a brighter location where it will get filtered sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly, allowing the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings.
Don't allow the soil to get soggy because it will quickly kill the plant. Water less in winter, while plant is not actively growing.
Remember to always use room-temperature water to water your tropical house plants; cold water is a shock to them.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks in spring and summer with a water-soluble fertilizer.
