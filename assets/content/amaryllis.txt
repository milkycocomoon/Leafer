<h3>General</h3>
<p>
These bulbs produce magnificent trumpet-shaped blooms in red, white, yellow, pink, and salmon.
In addition to solid-colored petals, there are many varieties with stripes, contrasting edges - even double blooms.
A single stem will produce 4 flowers, and large bulbs may produce 2 stems.

<p><b>Steps to Forcing Amaryllis Bulbs</b></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Plant the bulb in a pot that's just big enough to hold it, with the top third of the bulb above the soil line.</li>
<li>2. Water and set it in bright light, in a cool (around 60°F/16°C) place.
To prevent rot, water sparingly until the flower stem appears, then increase water. Check it often because flowering plants are thirsty.</i></li>
<li>3. When a 6-inch/15 cm stem appears, move the potted bulb to a sunlit spot.</li>
<li>4. You can expect blooms 6-8 weeks after planting. The long, strap-like leaves will appear long after the stems are grown.
Blooms will last for several weeks if kept at a maximum of 65°F/18°C.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>What to Do After the Bloom</b></p>
<p> After the flowers fade, cut off the stems and let the leaves grow to nourish the bulb.
Continue to water and fertilize the plant. Gradually reduce watering so that the leaves die back.
Cut off the brown leaves. Allow the bulb to rest by storing it in a paper bag in a cool (50°F/10°C), dry place for at least 2 months. Plant it again in fresh soil 6-8 weeks before you want it to bloom.

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Offsets may grow around the bulb. Leave them attached for 2 seasons before breaking them off and planting them in their own pots.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light to full sun during growing season. Turn pot occasionally so that all sides are exposed to light for even growth.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Keep potting mix evenly moist, but not soggy, during growing season.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks while amaryllis is growing, with half-strength, high-phosphorus water-soluble fertilizer.
