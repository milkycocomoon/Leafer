<h3>General</h3>
<p>
This evergreen hibiscus shrub has upright branches densely covered with glossy, dark-green ovate leaves.
</p>

<p>
Giant hibiscus flowers can grow 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) across, with ruffled, trumpet-shaped blooms in red, white, pink, yellow, peach,
orange and purple. Flowers may be single, semi-double or double, depending on the variety.
You can expect bloom life to be about 2-3 days, with a succession of blooms that last for months.
</p>

<p><b>Let the sun shine in.</b> Flowering plants need plenty of light to bloom. And this tropical beauty needs more than most.
Keep it where it'll get a few hours of direct sun every day.
If you put hibiscus outside for the summer, find a spot for it in a mostly sunny area and leave it there.
</p>

<p><b>Keep it warm.</b> Hibiscus plants need warmth. That's not difficult to provide in a home.
A sunny window will give it the light and warmth it needs to thrive.
</p>

<p><b>Pinch and prune.</b> Unless you want a huge shrub in your home, pruning hibiscus is necessary.
To control its size, prune it back in spring - by half when necessary.
Pinch growing tips to help it branch out. Hibiscus grows flower buds at the end of new branches, so you'll get more blooms this way.
</p>

<p><b>Give it a rest.</b> Keep your hibiscus cool in winter (about 60째F/16째C) and allow soil to dry out between waterings.
</p>

<h3>Propagation</h3>
<p>
Take 3 in (8 cm) stem tip cuttings in spring or early summer. Growing hibiscus from cuttings can take several weeks.
</p>

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
Bright light with some direct sunlight. Plants that don't get enough light will grow tall and leggy, with few blooms.
Growing hibiscus in a sunny spot outdoors for the summer will give it more blooming power.
Just be sure to bring it back inside before the temperature drops to 50째F/10째C at night. It's tropical, not cold-hardy.
Try to move your plant back inside gradually. Sudden changes in light can cause the leaves to turn yellow and drop off.
Raising the humidity around the plant can help.
</p>

<h3>Watering</h3>
<p>
Water thoroughly and allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.
Put it in a pot with drainage holes to prevent soggy soil.
</p>

<h3>Fertilizer</h3>
<p>
Feed every 2 weeks with a water-soluble fertilizer specially made for hibiscus (at half the recommended strength) while plant is growing and flowering.
