            <h3>Preventing Problems</h3>
            <p>
                Most bugs and diseases arrive with new plants. You can prevent a lot of problems by simply inspecting a plant thoroughly before bringing it home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are a few things to look for before you buy house plants:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leaves with brown spots, holes, or nibbled edges: these are sure signs of pest infestation or disease.</li>
                <li>Insects anywhere on the plant. If you bring these unwanted bugs into your home, they will likely attack your other plants, too.</li>
                <li>Powdery mildew on the leaves: this white, dusty fungus is not a good start for a young plant. Don't buy it.</li>
                <li>Gray fuzzy mold anywhere on the plant: this fungus may spread and attract insects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's also a good idea to keep new plants away from the others for a month to avoid a pest invasion on your other plants.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="HousePlantDiseases">
            <h3>Diseases</h3>
            <p>
                Keeping your plant healthy is its best defense for fighting off house plant diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
                A plant that's under stress from underwatering, overwatering, too much or too little sun - whatever the reason - is more vulnerable to diseases than a healthy plant. Fortunately, many problems are treatable if caught early. But remember, prevention is always better than the cure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Poor air circulation and high humidity are favorable conditions for powdery mildew. Watch for this dusty, white fungus on tops of leaves and on flowers. African violets and begonias are especially susceptible because of their thick, soft leaves and their need for high humidity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Promptly remove any dead flowers and leaf stems from your plant. Under moist conditions, fungus thrives on dead plant tissue and becomes a breeding ground for diseases and attracts insects.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="HousePlantPests">
            <h3>Pests</h3>
            <p>
                Look over your plants regularly for signs of pests. Many of these critters have preferred locations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#Whiteflies" class="in-text-link">Whiteflies</a> look like tiny, white moths and fly around when the plant is shaken. Whiteflies and their larvae tend to lurk on the undersides of leaves.</li>
                <li><a href="#Mealybugs" class="in-text-link">Mealybugs</a> are small, white, and fuzzy. They feed on or around the leaf axils or under the leaves. Their eggs are incubated in white, cottony areas. Some species feed on roots.</li>
                <li><a href="#Aphids" class="in-text-link">Aphids</a> typically attack new growth of plants - young leaves, buds and flowers.</li>
                <li><a href="#SpiderMites" class="in-text-link">Spider mites</a> are tiny specks on webbing on the undersides of leaves and between stems and leaves.</li>
                <li><a href="#Scale" class="in-text-link">Scale</a> are flat, brown, hard-shelled insects that cling to the stems on the underside of leaves.</li>
                <li><a href="#Thrips" class="in-text-link">Thrips</a> are tiny, thin and dark. The adults have fuzzy wings, but they tend to hop instead of fly.</li>
                <li><a href="#FungusGnats" class="in-text-link">Fungus gnats</a> look like tiny, black flies with transparent wings. They can barely fly, hovering over or crawling on the soil. Their eggs and larvae stay in the soil.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Clean your house plants. Keeping plants dust-free not only helps them stay healthy and attractive, it also helps to rid them of insects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before resorting to harsh chemicals to control pests, try to remove insects by wiping them off with a damp cloth or with soapy water. If that doesn't work, neem oil insecticide is an organic solution for eliminating many common house plant pests. It even controls some types of fungus on plants.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="Whiteflies">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/pests_01.webp" alt="Whiteflies">
            <h2>Whiteflies</h2>
            <p>
                Whiteflies (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) look like tiny moths with 4 powdery white wings. Their eggs and larvae are yellowish-green in color and barely visible without a magnifying glass.
            </p>

            <h3>Where to Find</h3>
            <p>
                These tiny winged insects will likely be found on the undersides of leaves where they suck plant juices, causing the leaves to turn yellow and appear limp. They secrete honeydew - a sticky substance which encourages growth of sooty mold. Honeydew is sweet and sometimes attracts ants that like to feed on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll see them flutter around like snowflakes when an infested plant is disturbed.
            </p>
            <p>
                They're not picky eaters - they'll feed on more than 60 species of plants. Soft-leaf plants are among of their favorites, including African violet, Chrysanthemum, Flowering maple, Gerbera daisy and Cape primrose.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a good idea to check over your plants once a week for any signs of an invasion - wilted or weakened growth, yellow mottled leaves, leaf drop, sticky honeydew, and sooty mold.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Get Rid of Whiteflies</h3>
            <p>
                Isolate and treat your plant as soon as you notice the infestation. White fly reproduces quickly and can kill your plant. Whitefly control will prevent them from invading your other house plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prune heavily infested leaves as soon as you notice them. They're not likely to recover from the feeding by these plant-sucking insects.
            </p>
            <p>
                If only a few leaves are infested, wipe off eggs and larvae with a damp cloth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The adults are susceptible to insecticides. Use <b>Insecticidal Soap</b> made for indoor plants. Spray every 2-3 days for 4 weeks or as needed. Make sure your plant is listed on the product label. Read the label carefully and follow the manufacturer's directions for use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put a <b>Sticky Whitefly Trap</b> on a stake in each pot of an infested plant to catch them. Whiteflies are attracted to the bright yellow color and once they land on the sticky surface...they're stuck. These sticky traps are affective in attracting catching flying pests - whiteflies, thrips and fungus gnats. They're safe to use indoors and in the greenhouse.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="Mealybugs">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/pests_02.webp" alt="Mealybugs">
            <h2>Mealybugs</h2>
            <p>
                Mealybugs are small, white insects with a white, waxy, fluffy coating that make them look like specks of cotton. They form colonies and destroy plant tissue by feeding on plant juices. They secrete honeydew - a sticky substance which attracts sooty mold and ants. White cottony areas are where they incubate their eggs.
            </p>

            <h3>Where to Find</h3>
            <p>
                These pests have favorite feeding places: underneath leaves, along the stems, and particularly in the leaf axils.
            </p>
            <p>
                They also have favorite house plants: African violet, begonia, coleus, croton, and cactus and other succulents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some feed on roots. You may find root-feeding bugs on the bottom of pots. Or you can ease the plant out of its pot to look for white, woolly masses around its roots.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Get Rid of Mealybugs</h3>
            <p>
                Controlling these strange bugs is difficult. The cottony wax coverings on the insects and egg sacs protect them from sprays.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are loosely attached to plants, so they are easily removed by hand. Use a cotton swab dipped in <b>rubbing alcohol</b> to wipe off all the bugs you can find. Look at places where the leaves are attached to stems, which is their favorite place to hide. Repeat applications every few days until the plant is free of bugs. Try not to cover a whole leaf with alcohol, because it can damage plant tissue.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get rid of root-feeding mealybugs, wash the pests and soil from the roots with tepid water. Cut away any damaged roots, then repot the plant in fresh potting mix.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may want to try a <b>systemic insecticide</b>. This is placed in the soil and taken up by the plant, which puts a toxin into the entire plant system. Insects that feed on treated plants are poisoned when they suck the plant's juices. Systemic insecticide helps to control other sucking insects, too. Many newer products are based on the active ingredient imidacloprid, which is less toxic to people and pets than older insecticides. Read the label carefully and follow the manufacturer's directions for use.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your plant is severely infested, get rid of it. Heavily infested plants do not grow well and may even die. Plus, you don't want these uninvited house guests to move on to your other plants.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="Aphids">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/pests_03.webp" alt="Aphids">
            <h2>Aphids</h2>
            <p>
                Aphids are tiny, soft-bodied insects that may be black, green, brown, or red. They are pear-shaped and have long legs. Some have wings and others are wingless.
            </p>

            <h3>Where to Find</h3>
            <p>
                They typically attack soft, new growth of plants. You may find them clustered on growing tips, young stems, and flower buds. They cause damage to houseplants when they suck plant juices, leaving sticky deposits of plant sap called honeydew. If you discover a sticky substance on houseplant leaves or surfaces below your plant, your plant likely has an infestation.
            </p>
            <p>
                These plant-sucking insects cause distorted leaves and buds. Some types feed on roots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aphids thrive in warm and humid conditions and are likely to invade plants in the spring and summer months. However, they can show up any time of the year and multiply quickly. Look for them clustering on buds, leaves, and stems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aphids are visible, especially along stems and leaf axils. Treat infested plants immediately because these pests can quickly cause damage, then move on to your other houseplants.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Get Rid of Aphids</h3>
            <p>
                Home remedies sometimes do the trick. Try water or soapy water first, before resorting to harsh chemicals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wipe off plant leaves - top and bottom - with a <b>damp cloth</b>. This will remove insects and their eggs. If you have a large infestation, spray the plant with water several times to dislodge the pests from the plant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clean heavily infested plants with a cloth or sponge dipped in <b>soapy water</b>. Use mild dishwashing liquid that doesn't contain fragrance or other additives. Squirt 2 teaspoonfuls into 1 gallon of room-temperature water and gently wash the plant's leaves, undersides of leaves, and the base of the leaves where they attach to the stems. If this seems too tedious, cover the soil with a newspaper or plastic wrap, hold the plant by its base, and plunge the foliage into the soapy water. Wait 10 minutes then rinse the plant well using room-temperature water.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a good idea to spray your plant once a week with a solution of soap and water to prevent bugs from coming back. Remember to rinse the plant with clear water afterward to remove any soapy residue.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Rubbing alcohol</b> kills aphids, too. Dab them with a cotton swab soaked in rubbing alcohol. Repeat applications every 2 to 3 days. This method works well, but use it with caution. Covering the whole leaf with alcohol damages plant tissue.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a large infestation, or just some stubborn bugs, try an <b>Insecticidal Soap</b>. Made of sodium or potassium salts, insecticidal soaps are effective and are not harmful to people or pets if they are used as directed on the manufacturer's label.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="SpiderMites">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/pests_04.webp" alt="Spider Mites">
            <h2>Spider Mites</h2>
            <p>
                Spider mites are perhaps the most dreaded of house plant pests. By the time you notice their faint webbing, the plant is seriously infested. Mites form colonies and multiply quickly. Most eggs are female and adult females lay about 100 eggs, with eggs hatching just 3 days after they're laid. The whole lifecycle - from egg to egg-laying adult takes only 2 weeks. If not controlled, mites can destroy a plant and then move on to nearby plants.
            </p>

            <h3>What They Look Like</h3>
            <p>
                Often called "red spider mites", they may be red, green, or yellow. Indoors, the most common is the two-spotted spider mite. But, you won't notice their spots. Mites are specks about the size of pepper flakes. And they are true spiders, not insects.
            </p>
            <p>
                They suck plant juices with their needle-sharp mouthparts. Attacks can cause leaves to look mottled and yellow, dusty, distorted, or dry out and drop off. Uncontrolled infestation can kill a plant.
            </p>

            <h3>Where to Find</h3>
            <p>
                These eight-legged pests are so tiny, you need a magnifying glass to see them. You'll likely notice their fine webbing first. Look for webbing on the undersides of leaves and between leaves. If you tap the leaf over a sheet of white paper, you may be able to see moving specks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spider mites love warm (70-80°F/21-27°C), dry conditions, making heated homes in winter an ideal environment for them to thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ivy is a favorite house plant for these bugs.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Get Rid of Spider Mites</h3>
            <p>
                Isolate the plant and prune badly infested or damaged leaves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clean infested plants with a cloth or sponge dipped in <b>soapy water</b>. Use mild dishwashing liquid that doesn't contain fragrance or other additives. Squirt 2 teaspoonfuls into 1 gallon of room-temperature water and gently wash the plant's leaves, especially the undersides of leaves. Rinse well.
            </p>
            <p>
                To wash the long stems of ivy, make a sinkful of soapy, room-temperature water. Swish the ivy stems through it with your hand for several minutes, then rinse thoroughly in clear room-temperature water. This should destroy any mites on the plant. Repeat in 2-3 days if necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                For heavy infestations, spray plant with an <b>Insecticidal Soap</b> made for indoor plants. Spray every 2-3 days to break the life cycle. It may take several applications. Make sure your plant is listed on the product label. Read the label carefully and follow the manufacturer's directions for use.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Neem oil</b> works great. It's proven to kill these pests and their eggs. It's an organic insecticide that's safe to use on indoor plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Increasing the humidity around your plant may help to prevent another invasion.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="Scale">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/pests_05.webp" alt="Scale">
            <h2>Scale</h2>
            <p>
                Scale are flat, tiny, reddish-brown insects that suck plant juices, leaving a sticky coating on leaves. Adult scale insects develop a hard, round shell which can make them difficult to kill.
            </p>

            <h3>Where to Find</h3>
            <p>
                Most scale are found attached to the stems and the backs of leaves, usually along central leaf veins. You may notice the affected areas to be weak and turn yellow. Scale are especially a nuisance to ficus and ferns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Honeydew is excreted as these insects suck on plant juices. This sticky substance can be found on leaves, and also the floor or table beneath the plant.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Get Rid of Scale Insects</h3>
            <p>
                Young scale insects can usually be controlled with a spray of <b>soapy water</b>. Use mild dishwashing liquid that doesn't contain fragrance or other additives. Mix 2 teaspoonfuls with 1 gallon of room-temperature water. Use a spray bottle to spray the soapy water and coat the leaves and stems thoroughly. Spray once a week for at least a month or until you no longer find insects. Always rinse off the soapy solution thoroughly with room-temperature water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adult scale can be more difficult to remove. If spraying doesn't work, use an old toothbrush dipped in soapy water to scrub them off. Heavily infested areas should be pruned.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Rubbing alcohol</b> kills many house plant insects, including scale. Dab them with a cotton swab soaked in rubbing alcohol. Repeat applications every 2 to 3 days. This works well, but use it with caution. Covering the whole leaf with alcohol damages plant tissue.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the infestation is bad, use a <b>Insecticidal Soap</b>. Make sure your plant is listed on the product label. Read the label carefully and follow the manufacturer's directions for use.

            <h2>Thrips</h2>
            <p>
                Thrips are thin, black insects with feathery wings. They're tiny and difficult to see unless disturbed, hopping quickly or flying away. They're not common on indoor plants. More typically found in the outdoor flower garden, they can hitch a ride indoors on plants, people and pets. Once inside, they have no choice but to feed on your house plants. They multiply quickly, so it doesn't take long before you have a large infestation on your hands.

                These insects suck plant juices with their needle-sharp mouthparts, causing a great deal of damage to plants. They feed on both leaves and flowers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thrip larvae is on the surface of the soil, so be sure to treat the soil, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thrips damage is worst in hot, dry conditions. Obvious signs of infestation are silvery streaked areas on leaves and dark spots on flowers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Check your house plants regularly and treat any infestation as soon as you notice it. Insects manage to reproduce quickly, and with a large population, will do a lot of damage.

            <h3>How to Get Rid of Scale Insects</h3>
            <p>
                Isolate the plant so they don't move on to your other plants. Prune any heavily damaged leaves or flowers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The easiest way to remove these insects is to wash them off with a fine <b>spray of water</b>. It's a good idea to spray your plant again after a few days.
            </p>
            <p>
                If that doesn't do the trick, there are other non-toxic treatments that will work. Use <b>Insecticidal Soap</b> made for indoor plants. Spray every 2-3 days for 4 weeks or as needed. Make sure your plant is listed on the product label. Read the label carefully and follow the manufacturer's directions for use.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Neem oil</b> is effective in getting rid of thrips. Neem oil doesn't kill them immediately - it causes them to stop feeding so that they die.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Blue sticky traps</b> placed near the plant are also a good option. Although many other pests are drawn to yellow sticky traps, research shows thrips are attracted to bright blue.

            <h2>Fungus Gnats</h2>
            <p>
                Fungus gnats look like tiny, black flies with grayish transparent wings. The adults are about 1/16-in (.2 cm) long and have long legs and antennae. Being so small, they can enter a home through the tiniest of openings. They sometimes arrive in a newly purchased bag of potting mix.
            </p>
            <p>
                They're more of an annoyance than anything. They are harmless to humans, and unlike many house plant pests, the adult gnats don't feed on plants. They're attracted to moist organic matter such as peat moss and fir bark in many potting mixes, and overwatered plants will draw them...well, like flies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you're wondering...why treat my plants? The fungus gnat life cycle is quick and they may take over your whole plant collection if left untreated. Most of these insects are females that will lay 100-300 eggs in crevices of the soil. The eggs hatch into larvae in 4-6 days and feed on plant roots, damaging your plants and leaving them susceptible to disease. After feeding for a couple weeks, they go through a pupal stage in the soil. In less than a week, they emerge as adults to begin the cycle all over again.
            </p>

            <h3>Where to Find</h3>
            <p>
                Although they have wings, they can barely fly. You'll find the gnats crawling on the soil or hovering just above the soil surface. Because they are dark like soil, they are difficult to detect unless they are moving. You'll see them stir if you blow on your plant or when you water it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seedlings and moisture-loving plants such as African violets and ferns are a favorite home for these pests. Overwatered plants are also a haven for them.

            <h3>How to Get Rid of Fungus Gnats</h3>
            <p>
                Controlling these insects can be as simple as <b>allowing the soil to dry out</b> between waterings. If your plant will tolerate dry soil for a short time, this may be the solution. I tried this on my heartleaf philodendron. I stopped watering it for 2 weeks to let the soil dry out and the gnats just disappeared. If your plant is not drought-tolerant, try one of the other solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can catch the adult insects by staking a <b>yellow sticky trap</b> in each infested plant container. This will catch the adults, but not the larvae. <b>Insecticidal soaps</b> labeled for fungus gnats can be used for killing the adult insects.
