            <h3>Basics</h3>
            <p>
                When it comes to basic houseplant care, there are several key factors to consider. Here are some general tips:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#Light" class="in-text-link">Light</a>: Different houseplants have varying light requirements. Some prefer bright, indirect light, while others thrive in low light conditions. It's important to place your plants in an appropriate location based on their light needs. Check the plant's tag or do some research to determine the ideal light conditions for your specific houseplant.</li>
                <li><a href="#Watering" class="in-text-link">Watering</a>: Proper watering is crucial for the health of your houseplants. The frequency of watering depends on factors such as the plant species, pot size, and environmental conditions. It's important to avoid overwatering or underwatering your plants. Generally, it's best to water when the top inch of soil feels dry. Use your finger or a moisture meter to check the soil moisture level before watering.</li>
                <li><a href="#Humidity" class="in-text-link">Humidity</a>: Some houseplants, especially tropical varieties, thrive in higher humidity levels. You can increase humidity around your plants by misting them with water, placing a tray of water near the plants, or using a humidifier. However, not all plants require high humidity, so it's important to know the specific needs of your houseplants.</li>
                <li><span class="in-text-link">Temperature</span>: Most houseplants prefer temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (18-29 degrees Celsius). Avoid placing your plants near drafts, such as radiators, air conditioning units, or vents, as extreme temperature changes can stress the plants.</li>
                <li><a href="#Fertilizer" class="in-text-link">Fertilizing</a>: Houseplants generally benefit from regular fertilization to provide them with essential nutrients. Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer or a slow-release fertilizer specifically formulated for houseplants. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging for proper application and frequency.</li>
                <li><a href="#Grooming" class="in-text-link">Pruning and grooming</a>: Regularly remove dead or yellowing leaves, as well as any spent flowers or stems. This helps maintain the overall appearance and health of the plant. Additionally, wiping the leaves with a damp cloth can help remove dust and keep them clean.</li>
                <li><a href="./blog_pests-and-deseases.html" class="in-text-link">Pest control</a>: Keep an eye out for common houseplant pests such as aphids, mealybugs, and spider mites. If you notice any signs of infestation, take appropriate measures to control the pests, such as using insecticidal soap or neem oil. Quarantine any infested plants to prevent the pests from spreading to other plants.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Indoor Plant Lighting</h2>
          <p>Indoor plant lighting gives plants most of the energy they need to grow, thrive, even to stay alive.</p>
          <p>The proper type of indoor plant light is more than just a matter of giving a plant the brightness it needs. There are three lighting factors that control growth of a plant:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Amount of light:</b> number of hours of daylight on your plants</li>
            <li><b>Intensity of light:</b> levels of light from full sun to full shade</li>
            <li><b>Spectrum:</b> warm and cool colors</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="LightExposure">Light exposure</h3>
          <p>Wondering what plant to put where? Here's an indoor plant lighting guide to four categories of light exposure for house plants.</p>
          <p><b>Direct sun</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Within 2 feet of a south- or southwest-facing window</li>
            <li>Window sills flooded with sunlight</li>
            <li>A sun room</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Bright/Indirect sun</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Within 4-5 feet of an east- or west-facing window</li>
            <li>3-5 feet from a window that faces south or southwest</li>
            <li>Any place where the sun shines into a room for several hours</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Partially shaded/Low light</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>An east-facing window where the morning sun shines into the room for only a few hours. Morning sun is cooler than afternoon sun, so you don't have to worry about overheating your plant</li>
            <li>At least 3-5 feet away from a window that faces south or southwest</li>
            <li>Directly in front of a north-facing window gives a plant low-to-medium light intensity</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Shade</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>More than 6 feet away from a south- or southwest-facing window</li>
            <li>Hallways, staircases, and corners of rooms</li>
            <li>Near windows that are shaded by trees</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="GettingLightRight">Getting Light right</h3>
          <p>How do you know when your house plant is <b>not getting enough light</b>? It will tell you. Here are some things to look for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Growth is spindly, with long spaces between leaves</li>
            <li>New leaves are smaller than existing ones</li>
            <li>Lower leaves turn yellow and fall off</li>
            <li>No growth or slow growth</li>
            <li>Flowering plants fail to bloom or bloom poorly</li>
            <li>Variegated leafy plants turn a solid green</li>
            <li>New shoots reach out and grow toward the light</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here are some signs that your plant is getting <b>too much light:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Brown scorched patches on leaves</li>
            <li>Leaves look faded or washed out</li>
            <li>Plant wilts at midday</li>
            <li>Leaves become dry and fall off</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="ArtificialLight">Artificial Light</h3>
          <p>If your rooms don't have enough light for your house plants, artificial indoor plant lighting may be the solution. It can supplement natural daylight - or even replace it during the winter months when the days are shorter and the intensity of light is much lower.</p>
          <p>Artificial lights provide the sun's spectrum of wavelengths, which we identify as colors. For example, white light carries all the colors of the rainbow. Plants need the cool blue and violet hues of the spectrum for foliage, and the warm red and orange for flowering.</p>
          <p>Reading light is mostly green and yellow - two colors that plants don't need.</p>
          <p><b>Fluorescent lights</b> are efficient because they provide the type of light (the blue and red parts of the spectrum) that plants need for photosynthesis. A good setup includes a half-and-half combination of cool-white and warm-white fluorescent tubes mounted under a reflector. They should be 40 watts each.</p>
          <p>Keep foliage plants at least 12 inches below the lights and flowering plants 6-12 inches below the lights. If it's not practical to lower the light fixture, you can raise the plants themselves.</p>
          <p><b>Which plants are best for artificial light?</b> Many flowering house plants come to mind because they need bright light to bloom: Begonia, Bromeliad, African violet, Orchid, and Cyclamen. However, many foliage plants also respond beautifully to artificial lighting: Polka-dot plant, Spider plant, Peperomia, Nerve plant, and Aloe vera.</p>
          <p><b>How long should lights be on?</b> It depends on the type of plant. Foliage plants need about 14-16 hours of light per day. Flowering plants need 12-16 hours of light per day. Darkness is also important for plant growth so this gives your plants at least 8 hours of total darkness a day. Try to have the lights on at the same time every day. You can get an automatic timer for your lights to make it easier. Just set it and it'll come on the same time every day.</p>
          <p>If you water your plants on a schedule, you'll want to keep a closer eye on them. <b>Plants grown under artificial indoor plant lighting may dry out quicker</b> and need watered more often.</p>

          <h2>Watering House Plants</h2>
          <p>Although it seems easy enough, watering house plants is responsible for killing more plants than anything else. These indoor plant watering tips will help to keep your plants healthy.</p>
          <p><b>How Much Water Does a Plant Need?</b> The answer varies with the species and its native habitat, the soil in which it is growing, and the light, temperature, and humidity in your home. Plants with a lot of leaf surface or soft, lush foliage will be thirstier than those with less foliage or waxy or leathery leaves.</p>
          <p>House plant watering needs are also affected by the growth cycle of the plant. A plant absorbs more water during active growth periods (in spring and summer) than during rest periods.</p>
          <p><b>House plants hate cold water!</b> Watering house plants with cold water can slow growth or damage roots. Use tepid water. Or, let cold tap water warm up to room temperature overnight.</p>

          <h3 id="Rainwater">Rainwater</h3>
          <p>Plants like rainwater because it's naturally soft and chemical-free.</p>
          <p>Tap water often contains chlorine, fluoride and other chemicals that can be damaging to plants. Use a water softener? It will also add sodium to your water. Hard water will leave lime deposits on leaves, so it can harm plants too.</p>
          <p>Rainwater is clean of minerals, salts and even chlorine that is added to some public water supplies. Besides saving money on your water bill, you'll give your plants good quality water to drink.</p>

          <h3 id="FlushingSalts">Flushing Salts</h3>
          <p>Wondering about that white crusty stuff on the surface of your plant's potting mix?</p>
          <p>It's a build up of soluble salts that come from tap water and fertilizers. These salts not only look unsightly, they can damage foliage and roots. You'll notice plant damage as wilted, yellow or scorched leaves.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, getting rid of excess salts is easy. Place your house plant in a sink or take it outdoors on a warm day. Slowly pour tepid water over the potting mix. Allow water to drain out the drainage holes of the pot. Pour more water through the pot, then empty the drainage tray.</p>

          <h3 id="Overwatering">Overwatering</h3>
          <p>Contrary to popular belief, over-watering house plants is more often the cause for a plant's problems than under-watering. Since roots cannot absorb more water than the plant needs, the excess water will take the place of oxygen in the soil. Plants need oxygen just like we do. Soggy soil suffocates the roots and leads to rot.</p>
          <p><b>How to save overwatered plant:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tip the plant on its side for a few minutes to allow the water to drain out.</li>
            <li>Cover the top of the soil with paper towels to absorb the extra moisture. Replace them with dry paper towels when they become saturated.</li>
            <li>If the plant starts to wilt or lose its leaves, repot it right away with fresh soil into a container that has good drainage.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="Humidity">
          <img src="../assets/images/blog/care_01-03.webp" alt="Humidity for House Plants">
          <h2>Humidity for House Plants</h2>
          <p>Many house plants prefer higher humidity than is usually found in a home. Tropical plants are healthiest with relative humidity around 50-60% - far higher than most homes.</p>

          <p><b>How to keep humidity level:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you want to do this for one room, a small room humidifier works well. Use one with a cool, fine mist and place the humidifier close enough to your plants to provide moisture, without getting the foliage wet.</li>
            <li>Mist the plants every day - or as needed - with a fine mist of room-temperature water. Use a mister with a fine spray to prevent big drops of water from settling on foliage. Misting only works well if you can do this several times a day because the moisture quickly evaporates.</li>
            <li>Set the container on a tray filled with pebbles. The tray should be filled with just enough water so that the top half of the pebbles and the pot itself remain dry, so the plant won't draw up more water. The water will evaporate, increasing the humidity in the air around the plant's leaves.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A humidity tray with pebbles allows you to use pots with drain holes without worrying about excess water pouring out and damaging furniture. The overflow will collect in the tray where the settled water will evaporate, surrounding the foliage with moist air. Care is easy - just wash the tray with mild soap and water occasionally, then refill with water.</p>
          <p><b>Signs you need to boost humidity for house plants:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Plant wilts.</li>
            <li>Tips or edges of leaves turn brown.</li>
            <li>Flower buds develop poorly or wither soon after opening.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="Fertilizer">
          <img src="../assets/images/blog/care_01-04.webp" alt="Fertilizer">
          <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
          <p>While light gives plants the energy they require, house plant fertilizer provides the nutrients they need to grow healthy and strong.</p>

          <p><b>How to Choose House Plant Fertilizer.</b> The fertilizer you need depends on your plant. Read the labels carefully. They usually list three numbers, such as 10-20-10. These are (in order) the percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (often called potash) that make up the major nutrients in the house plant fertilizer. And here's what they do:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Nitrogen</b> gives the plant lush, green foliage and promotes growth.</li>
            <li><b>Phosphorus</b> keeps roots strong and healthy, and encourages flowering.</li>
            <li><b>Potassium</b> makes stems strong and helps fight off diseases.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Fertilizers specially formulated for flowering plants will contain less nitrogen and more phosphorus and potassium. You'll even find some labeled for specific plants, such as orchids. Most house plants need a balanced fertilizer such as a 10-10-10 formula.</p>
          <p>In addition to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, plants need small amounts of other nutrients, or trace minerals - called <b>micronutrients</b>.</p>

          <p><b>When Your Plant Needs Fertilizing:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weak new growth</li>
            <li>Pale leaves</li>
            <li>Dropped leaves</li>
            <li>Weak stems</li>
            <li>Small or no flowers</li>
          </ul>

          <p><b>Signs of over-fertilized plant:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scorched edges or brown spots on leaves</li>
            <li>Misshaped leaves</li>
            <li>Wilting leaves</li>
            <li>White crust on the surface of the potting mix</li>
          </ul>

          <p><b>Fertilizing Guidelines:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Never feed a new or newly repotted plant. A plant that relocates from the garden center to your home is stressed and will need a month or two to adjust to its new environment. Good potting mixes contain nutrients to feed a repotted plant for several weeks.</li>
            <li>Don't use as much house plant fertilizer as recommended on the label. For some reason, manufacturers suggest the maximum amount that a healthy plant can tolerate.</li>
            <li>Fertilizer is not a cure-all for an unhealthy plant. Never feed a plant that's suffering from root damage, disease or insects.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="Grooming">
          <img src="../assets/images/blog/care_01-05.webp" alt="Pinching, Pruning and Cleaning">
          <h2>Pinching, Pruning and Cleaning</h2>
          <p>House plants occasionally need grooming to keep them healthy and attractive. Regular maintenance not only makes your plants look their best, it helps to prevent pests and diseases, too.</p>

          <h3>Pinching</h3>
          <p>Using your thumb and forefinger to remove a tip of a stem is known as pinching a plant.</p>
          <p>Pinching off growing tips will keep a fast-growing vine compact or help to maintain a plant's bushy shape. When a young stem tip is pinched off, the plant will branch out and become bushier and fuller.</p>
          <p>Always pinch above a node - the growing point where a leaf is attached. Cuts made here usually force branching below the cut.</p>

          <h3>Pruning</h3>
          <p>Never pull on stems or leaves to remove them. Use sharp pruners or scissors to make clean cuts and to avoid tearing - which can attract a fungal disease. </p>
          <p>Cut off any dead stems or branches, which can attract fungus. Remove brown or yellow leaves as well so they don't decay and attract disease and insects.</p>
          <p>Pruning house plants is best when the plant is actively growing, usually in the spring and summer months, although light trimming can be done any time of year.</p>
          <p>Cut above a leaf node (the place where a leaf attaches to the stem) at a 45° angle. Cuts made here will help the plant to branch out, creating a fuller, more compact plant.</p>

          <h3>Cleaning</h3>
          <p>Keeping your plant's leaves dust-free helps it get the light exposure it needs to grow. Cleaning the leaves also helps rid them of insects.</p>
          <p>Smooth leaves can easily be wiped clean with a damp cloth or a sponge dipped in water. It's a good idea to clean the cloth or sponge before using it on another plant so it's not giving insects a ride from one plant to another.</p>
          <p>Plants with hairy leaves, such as African violets, should be gently brushed with a soft brush to remove dust and dirt. Why? If water is used to clean hairy-leafed plants, water spots will develop on their leaves and they won't come off.</p>
          <p>Fine-foliage plants, such as ferns, can be cleaned with a gentle spray of water. When the weather is warm, sometimes it's easiest to take the plant outdoors and give it a fine spray of water from all sides with a water bottle. Cover the soil so that it doesn't become soggy. Gently shake off excess water and allow the plant to dry in a place protected from direct sun before returning it indoors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="Repotting">
          <img src="../assets/images/blog/care_01-06.webp" alt="Repotting House Plants">
          <h2>Repotting House Plants</h2>
          <p>House plants occasionally need grooming to keep them healthy and attractive. Regular maintenance not only makes your plants look their best, it helps to prevent pests and diseases, too.</p>
          <p>The most obvious sign when you need to repot the plant is when you can see roots on the surface of the soil or emerging from the drainage hole in the bottom of the pot.</p>
          <p>If the plant seems to stop growing or has slowed growth, it has likely become pot-bound. If it's a small plant, turn the pot on its side and ease the plant out of its container. Take a peek at its roots. Are they coiled in the bottom of the pot? If so, it's definitely time to repot.</p>

          <h3>When to Repot a Plant</h3>
          <p>If your plant just came home from the garden center, let it adjust to its new environment for a couple weeks before repotting it. Plants are in shock until they get used to new light, temperature, and humidity conditions. If you want to cover up a plain plastic container, put it in a cachepot.</p>
          <p>Young, actively growing house plants should to be moved into slightly larger pots with fresh potting mix once a year. Repotting house plants that are large, such as ficus, or slow-growing plants can be done every two years or when they seem to outgrow their pots or look top-heavy. If a plant is thriving, you can assume it is happy in its pot.</p>
          <p>It's a good idea to repot a plant at the beginning of a period of active growth, usually in spring. Repotting house plants that bloom in winter should be done in early fall, after their dormant period.</p>

          <h3>How to Choose a Container</h3>
          <p>The new pot should be no more than 2 inches wider at the rim - or 2 inches deeper - than the old pot. Why? A pot that's much larger gives the roots too much space to grow into. The top of the plant won't grow until its roots begin to fill the container.</p>
          <p>A too-large container will also hold too much water and can cause root rot. And while I'm on the subject - be sure to choose a container that has drainage holes to allow excess water to escape.</p>
          <p>Scrub used pots between plantings to remove any diseases. You can disinfect a pot by soaking it in a solution of one part chlorine bleach to nine parts water. Rinse well with clear water.</p>
          <p>If you're using a new terra cotta pot, soak it in water for a few hours before you plant in it. New terra cotta is so dry that it will rob moisture from the soil leaving the plant thirsty.</p>

          <h3>How to Repot a Plant</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>To remove the plant from its original pot, turn it on its side and ease the plant gently from the pot. If the plant won't budge, you may have to tap the bottom of the pot on a hard surface to loosen it. Or slide a trowel or knife around the inside of the pot, taking care not to damage the rootball.</li>
            <li>If the roots are coiled around the bottom, use your fingers to pull them straight. Prune the roots before potting. Pruning will stimulate new root growth and help the plant establish in its new container.</li>
            <li>Partly fill the new container with potting mix. Center the plant in its container, then fill the sides of the plant with additional mix. Tamp it down with your fingers, especially around the sides of the pot.</li>
            <li>Water thoroughly to moisten roots and to settle potting mix. Add more mix if needed.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>After-Repotting Tips</h3>
          <p>Do not expose it to direct sun right away because sun can be too harsh on a weakened plant.</p>
          <p>Keep the soil evenly moist, but not soggy. If you notice that the leaves are limp, the plant is not getting enough water. If the leaves turn yellow, it's getting too much water.</p>
          <p>High humidity sometimes helps a newly repotted plant recover.</p>
          <p>Never fertilize a newly repotted plant. Its roots have likely been cut and can suffer from fertilizer burn. Wait at least a month before fertilizing when its root system is better established.</p>

          <h2>Potting Soil</h2>
          <p>Although potting media is often referred to as potting soil - many commercial potting mixes contain little or no soil at all. Why? Soil can become compact in a container robbing the plant's roots of the oxygen they need.</p>
          <p>Don't even think about using garden soil for your house plants! Resist the temptation to dig up dirt from your garden and put it in a pot. Garden soil is a triple threat: it becomes too compact in a container, it could contain weed seeds, and there may be insects hiding in the soil. You don't want to start off your plant with these problems.</p>

          <p><b>Potting medium offers three things that a plant needs:</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Support (to keep the plant from falling over)</li>
            <li>It stores water and nutrients for the plant's roots, and still provides good drainage so that the plant doesn't get waterlogged</li>
            <li>Provides air circulation so that the roots can get oxygen</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Acidity and Alkalinity of Soil</h3>
          <p>It is measured as the soil's pH value, and ranges from 0-14. A pH7 value is neutral (preferred by most house plants), a higher number than 7 is alkaline, and a lower number than 7 is acidic.</p>

          <h3>Potting Soil Types</h3>
          <p>Ready-to-use potting mixes are often soilless. They are peat moss based or composed of some other partially decomposed plant material, such as ground fir bark. Vermiculite, perlite and sand can be added to the mix to allow more air into the soil and speed up drainage.</p>
          <p>Before you buy a bag at the nursery or garden center, take a look at its contents. Here's a list of common potting mix ingredients and what they do:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Peat moss</b> is the basic ingredient in most of today's commercial potting mixes. Made up of partially decomposed bog plants, it is ground into a coarse brown powder. Peat moss adds lightness to a mix and improves water retention. Plants that like moist potting soil, such as African violets, ferns and begonias, thrive in a peat moss-based mix because of its excellent ability to hold moisture.</li>
            <li><b>Bark</b> When you run your fingers through potting medium, you'll probably notice chunks of tree bark or bits of twigs. These coarse pieces help drainage and also prevent the medium from becoming compact, allowing air circulation around the plant's roots. Composted bark is commonly used in mixes for bromeliads and orchids.</li>
            <li><b>Sand</b> is often added to potting mixes to speed up drainage. Because coarse sand cannot hold moisture well, a sandy mix will dry out quickly, which is ideal for cacti and other succulents that prefer water in small gulps. Palms that are native to sandy seashores also grow well in a sandy potting mixture. Use only horticultural or washed sand that is free from salt and other impurities.</li>
            <li><b>Vermiculite</b> is made from natural mineral deposits and look like little flakes of gold. Besides helping to maintain aeration in a mix, vermiculite can absorb several times its weight in water and minerals, and release them slowly.</li>
            <li><b>Perlite</b> looks like small, white puffs. It's actually pieces of expanded volcanic rock with thousands of tiny air pockets that allow for perlite to take up and release water quickly. Besides regulating water in the medium, it helps improve drainage. Many potting mixes contain perlite, and those formulated for succulents often contain an extra helping.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Planting a Terrarium?</h3>
          <p><b>Charcoal</b> is used as a layer under the soil in terrariums and bottle gardens. Because these types of plantings won't get repotted, and the containers hold in moisture, the soil can get sour over time. Charcoal absorbs odors and keeps the soil fresh. This is horticultural charcoal, not the barbecue kind. Unless you're creating an enclosed planting such as this, you won't need it.</p>

          <h3>Buying Tips</h3>
          <p>You'll find packaged potting soil mixes in 2, 5, 10 and 20 quart bags at the nursery or garden center. A 2-quart bag is enough to plant 3 or 4 small plants.</p>
          <p>Before buying, squeeze the bag to test the quality of the potting soil mix. It should feel soft, pliable and lightly moist. Pass up any that are dry, caked, or looks gray instead of black - signs that it's old and probably lacking in nutrients. Unfortunately, even the best mixes only last a couple of years before the organic matter breaks down.</p>
