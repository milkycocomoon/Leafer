            <h3>Methods of Propagating House Plants</h3>
            <p>
                Propagating is simply taking part of a mature plant and growing it into a whole new plant. It's straightforward and anyone can do it. Here's how to propagate your indoor plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                First things first, the best time to propagate your plants is in late Spring, early Summer, when your plant is in full growth mode. Secondly, always make sure you're using a healthy, pest and disease free plant to propagate from, and make sure you're using clean secateurs.
            </p>
            <p><b>
                These are different ways of propagating houseplants:
            </b></p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#StemCuttings" class="in-text-link">Stem Cuttings</a> involve taking a portion of the stem with a node and rooting it to create a new plant.</li>
                <li><a href="#LeafCuttings" class="in-text-link">Leaf Cuttings</a> involve taking a leaf or a section of a leaf and rooting it to create a new plant.</li>
                <li><a href="#RootCuttings" class="in-text-link">Root Cuttings</a> involve taking a portion of the root to create a new plant.</li>
                <li><a href="#Division" class="in-text-link">Division</a> involves separating a mature plant into multiple smaller plants.</li>
                <li><a href="#Offsets" class="in-text-link">Offsets</a>. It's a specific type of division method used for plants that produce offsets or pups at the base of the plant. It involves separating these offsets from the parent plant and replanting them to create new plants.</li>
                <li><a href="./blog_starting-seeds-indoors.html" class="in-text-link">Seeds</a> involves collecting seeds from mature plants and sowing them in a suitable growing medium. However, it's important to note that not all house plants can be propagated from seeds, and this method may require more time and patience compared to other methods.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Stem Cuttings</h2>
            <p>Taking a cutting from a plant means removing part of the parent plant to grow a new one.</p>
            <p>Once a stem is cut, its moisture supply is cut off. So the moisture level needs to be maintained while the cutting grows its own roots.</p>
            <p>Some plants root so easily that the cutting can simply be placed in a glass of water. Others need help from a rooting hormone powder.</p>
            <p>Spring and summer are the best times to take cuttings, because the plant is actively growing.</p>
            <h3>How to propagate</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>From the tip of the stem count back to a minimum of 3 nodes (nodes are the notches along the stem where the leaves grow from), giving you about 10cm of plant material</li>
                <li>Make a clean cut just below the node and trim off the remaining bit of stem to just above the next node on your parent plant (otherwise it will die back and look ugly)</li>
                <li>Snip off all of the lower leaves from your cutting (leave one or two at the top)</li>
                <li>Pop your cutting in a glass of clean water. No leaves should be under the water because they'll rot, and all of the exposed nodes should be submerged - these are where your cutting will root from</li>
                <li>Leave the glass/jar near a light source until roots develop</li>
                <li>Refresh and/or top up the water regularly</li>
                <li>Once the stem has roots, plant it in soil and you're done</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="LeafCuttings">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/propagation_01-02.webp" alt="Leaf Cuttings">
            <h2>Leaf Cuttings</h2>
            <p>African violet is best known for this, but leaf cutting also works well for Rex begonias, Kalanchoes, and some Peperomias.</p>
            <p>Use a sharp knife or razor blade to cut the leaf stem about 1 inch below the leaf. Insert the stem just below the surface of moist potting mix at a 45Â° angle, taking care to keep the leaf above the potting mix. Once the plantlets form at the base of the cutting, cut away the parent leaf and pot in fresh potting mix.</p>
            <p>The leaves of Mother-in-law's tongue (Sansevieria trifasciata) can be propagated from only a section of a leaf. Cut the leaf into horizontal two-inch sections, taking care to keep them the same way up that they were growing, and insert each section into moist potting mix about one-third of its depth. Two or three plantlets will form from each leaf section.</p>
            <h3>How to propagate</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut a leaf from your plant, just above the soil surface</li>
                <li>You can use the whole leaf or if you want multiple plants, cut this leaf into 4-5cm sections, making sure you keep track of the 'top' and 'bottom' of each section (remember which direction the leaf was growing)</li>
                <li>At the bottom of each leaf section, cut a notch or V shape, angling your secateurs at a 45 degree angle from the corners towards the centre. This helps increase the surface area for maximum root growth</li>
                <li>Leave your cutting/s somewhere safe to dry for 48 hours, so the cut edges harden</li>
                <li>Once your cutting/s have calloused over, pop the angled end into a glass of water or nestle it in into a pot of free draining compost</li>
                <li>Pop your pot or glass in a sunny spot and either mist the soil to keep it moist (but not wet) or keep the water topped up and refreshed</li>
                <li>Wait for roots to grow</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="RootCuttings">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/propagation_01-03.webp" alt="Root Cuttings">
            <h2>Root Cuttings</h2>
            <p>To propagate a plant from a root cutting, insert the root pieces vertically in moist potting mix, keeping the ends that were closest to the crown at the top. When plantlets form, pot them in fresh potting mix.</p>
            <h3>How to propagate</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose the right time: Root cuttings are typically taken when the plant is dormant, which is usually in late autumn or early winter for herbaceous perennials. However, the specific timing may vary depending on the plant species</li>
                <li>Prepare the parent plant: Dig up the parent plant and cut a 2 to 3-inch (5-8 cm) section of the root tip. It's important to replant the parent plant right away and water it thoroughly if the soil is dry</li>
                <li>Prepare the root cuttings: Use a sharp knife to cut the root into sections. Each section should be about 2 to 3 inches (5-8 cm) long. Make sure each cutting has at least one growth bud or node. It's recommended to use a sharp knife instead of scissors or shears to avoid pinching the root</li>
                <li>Plant the root cuttings: Lay the root cuttings horizontally on a moist starting mix or soilless potting mix. The cut ends should be facing up. Cover the root cuttings with a thin layer of the mix, leaving the growth bud or node exposed. The shoots will grow from the cut ends of the root cuttings</li>
                <li>Provide appropriate care: Place the planted root cuttings in a location with indirect light and maintain a consistent level of moisture in the growing medium. Avoid overwatering, as excessive moisture can lead to rot. You can cover the container with a plastic bag or use a propagator to create a humid environment. This can help promote root development</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="paddings" id="Division">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/propagation_01-04.webp" alt="Division">
            <h2>Division</h2>
            <p>Dividing works well for mature plants that grow in a clump, such as Peace lily and Mother-in-law's tongue.</p>
            <p>Remove the plant from its pot and lay it on a flat surface. Carefully pull the roots apart, trying to do as little damage as possible. You may need to use a sharp knife for dense roots, taking care not to cut more than is necessary.</p>
            <h3>How to propagate</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove your plant from its nursery pot, to expose the roots</li>
                <li>Carefully split the root ball into half or quarters, making sure that each section has a healthy chunk of roots and a healthy bunch of foliage. If the root ball is really tight and you can't break it apart with your hands, you might need to cut or saw through it. Don't worry, your plant can handle it</li>
                <li>Pot each section into a nursery pot with fresh soil. Make sure it's quite a snug fit and that you pot up to the previous soil level, so that no roots are exposed. Gently firm the soil in around the root ball and tap the pot a few times to make sure the soil has settled</li>
                <li>Water as normal</li>
                <li>Your new plants may sulk for a few days but once they've found their feet (started to grow new roots into the fresh soil), they will perk up</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="paddings" id="Offsets">
            <img src="../assets/images/blog/propagation_01-05.webp" alt="Offsets">
            <h2>Offsets</h2>
            <p>Offsets are small, self-sustaining plants that develop from meristem regions of the parent plant, such as axillary buds or homologous structures. This method is commonly used for plants like Haworthias, Aloe, Snake Plants, ZZ Plants, and many others that produce offsets or clumps.</p>
            <p>To propagate through offset propagation, you typically wait until the offset has grown to a certain size, usually around 1 cm with a few leaves, before separating it from the mother plant. Gently twist or cut the offset from the parent plant, making sure to keep as many roots as possible. Then, you can plant the offset in its own pot with fresh potting soil and provide appropriate care.</p>
            <h3>How to propagate</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify offsets: Look for small, self-sustaining plants called offsets or pups that develop at the base of the parent plant</li>
                <li>Use a clean knife or shears to carefully remove the offsets from the parent plant</li>
                <li>After removing the offsets, set them aside in a dry and well-ventilated area for a few days to allow the cut ends to callus over. This callus formation helps protect the offsets from rotting when they are planted</li>
                <li>If using soil, create a small hole in the soil and gently place the callused end of the offset into the hole. If using water, submerge the base of the offset in the water, ensuring that the callused end is above the waterline. In both cases, make sure the offset is stable and upright</li>
                <li>Over time, the offsets will develop roots and establish themselves as independent plants</li>
